# 3 - 1 3 . Air Cleaner Filter Element Serv I C I N G

This task covers:
a. Removal **d. Cleaning** b. Inspection **e. Installation** c. Emergency Cleaning INITIAL SETUP:
Tools General mechanic's tool kit:
automotive (Appendix B, Item 1)
Materials/Parts Detergent (Appendix C, Item 17)
Manual References TM 9-2320-280-10 TM 9-2320-280-24P
Equipment Condition Hood raised and secured (TM 9-2320-280-10).

General Safety Instructions
- Compressed air used for cleaning purposes will not exceed 30 psi (207 kPa).

- If NBC contamination is suspected, consult NBC
officer or NBC NCO for appropriate handling instructions.

- Improper cleaning methods and use of unauthorized cleaning liquids can injure personnel and cause damage to equipment. Do not use anything other than compressed air, water, and detergent to clean elements.

- If NBC contamination is suspected, consult NBC officer or NBC
NCO for appropriate handling instructions.

a. Removal 1. Loosen bolt (8), and remove ring clamp (1), cover (2), and gasket (3) from air cleaner assembly (6). 2. Remove nut and washer assembly (7) and filter element (4) from stud (5) and air cleaner assembly (6).

3. Cover housing opening with screen or rag to prevent contaminants from entering the air intake system and damaging your engine.

#### B. Inspection

1. Check gasket (3) for dents, tears, rips, and other damage. Make sure the gasket has not taken a set.

Make sure there are no hard dirt ridges on the sealing surfaces.

2. Inspect filter element (4) for holes and tears by looking through the element toward a bright light. If pinpoints of light shine through, replace the element. Holes that are large enough to let light through are large enough to let contaminants through. Another way to check for leaks or damage is to look for uneven dirt patterns. Make sure there is no rust or flaking paint on metal parts of the filter. If the filter has already been cleaned three times, or if you find damage, replace it.

3. Check air cleaner assembly (6) for holes, dents, rust, or any other damage that will interfere with proper sealing and allow unfiltered air to enter and destroy engine.

c. Emergency Cleaning

Do not strike ends of filter element on hard surface or damage to filter element may result.

Remove dust or sand from filter element (4) by holding it so neither end faces ground. Gently tap around filter element (4) to free dust and sand.

![42_image_1.png](images/42_image_1.png)

# 3-13. Air Cleaner Filter Element Servicing (Cont'D)

Compressed air used for cleaning purpose will not exceed 30 psi (207 kPa). Use only with effective chip guarding and personnel protective equipment (goggles/shield, gloves, etc.).

Hold nozzle at least one inch away from element (1) and direct compressed air against clean side of element (1) (in direction opposite to normal air flow). Move air stream up and down length of pleats until you can not see dust being blown out.

1.

2.

Prepare a solution of five gallons warm water (80-110° F (26.7-43.3° C)) and approximately one cup of non-sudsing detergent in a container large enough to submerge the element (1). Never use gasoline or solvents of any kind to clean elements. Immerse the element (1) completely in the cleaning solution. Swish for two minutes. Soak the element in the cleaning solution for 15 to 20 minutes, then swish it around again to remove contaminants.

3.

Remove the element (1) from the solution and let it drain.

Rinse the element with cool water (35-80° F (1.7-26.7° C)) from clean side to dirty side (in direction opposite to normal air flow) with a gentle stream of water (no more than 40 psi (275.8 kpa)). If the clean side was contaminated during the soak cycle, rinse the element from both sides.

4.

5.

Air dry the element (1) at normal room temperature until completely dry. Usually overnight is adequate, but temperature and humidity will effect drying time. If you use circulating air, do not exceed 180° F (82.2° C). Do not use compressed air to speed drying time, you will damage your element. Reinspect the element (1) and discard if damaged. If it checks out O.K., mark the date of cleaning on it.

6.

7.

#### E. Installation

1. Remove screen or rag from housing opening. 2. Install filter element (1) into air cleaner assembly (6) and on stud (5) with nut and washer assembly (7). Tighten nut and washer assembly (7) to 20-40 lb-in (2-4 N-m).

When cover clamp is secured to end of filter body assembly, ensure the clamp bolt is between the three and six o'clock position to prevent damaging hood when hood is closed.

3. Install cover (3) and gasket (4) on air cleaner assembly (6) with ring clamp (2) as shown. Tighten bolt (8) to 35-40 lb-in (3-4 N-m).

1. If engine is hot, remove surge tank filler cap (1) by placing a thick cloth over cap (l). Press down and turn counterclockwise to its first stop to release internal pressure.

2. After pressure has escaped, press down and turn cap (1) counterclockwise again and remove.

b. Draining System 1. If engine is hot, repressurize system (see a. of this task).

> Note

Have drainage container ready to catch coolant.

2. Open draincock (4) and allow system to drain. 3. Close draincock (4).

c. Preventive Cleaning 1. For preventive cleaning, refer to TB 750-651.

2. Test surge tank filler cap (1), refer to TM 750-254.

d. Filling System

> Note

The cooling system for the vehicles covered in this manual has a 26 qt (25 l) capacity. Continue filling and allow air to escape. Ensure surge tank coolant level is 3/4 full before securing filler cap.

1. Ensure radiator draincock (4) is closed and heater control valve (3) is open (pull "TEMP" knob on dash to "MAX" position).

2. Fill system with proper antifreeze solution. See table 3-1 for preparation of antifreeze solutions.
