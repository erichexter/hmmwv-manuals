General Safety Instructions
- Wear safety goggles and rubber gloves and do not smoke when performing battery maintenance.

- Remove all jewelry. - When removing battery cables, disconnect ground cable first. Ensure all switches are in OFF position before disconnecting.

- Battery acid (electrolyte) is extremely harmful. Always wear safety goggles and rubber gloves, and do not smoke when performing battery maintenance. Severe injury will result if acid contacts eyes or skin.

- Remove all jewelry such as rings, dogtags, bracelets, etc. If jewelry or disconnected battery ground cable contacts battery terminal, a direct short can result, causing instant heating of tools, severe injury to personnel, or damage to equipment.

- Always disconnect both ground cables when performing battery maintenance on the "A2" series vehicles. The "A2" series vehicles have a 12 volt cable connected to the positive terminal, which keeps the electrical system charged when only one ground cable is disconnected. Failure to do this may cause injury to personnel, or damage to equipment.

- When removing battery cable clamps, disconnect both ground cables first. Ensure all switches are in OFF position before disconnecting. Do not allow tools to come in contact with vehicle when disconnecting cable clamps. A direct short can result, causing instant heating of tools, tool damage, battery damage, or battery explosion.

- Secure all cables to head side of mounting capscrews. - Use this procedure for disconnecting all battery cables. - The following procedure covers disconnection and connection of the ground cable.

#### A. Cleaning And Inspection

1. Inspect cables (1), (2), and (11) for corrosion and cracks. 2. Remove defective cables (1), (2), and (11), or clean with wire brush and baking soda solution.
