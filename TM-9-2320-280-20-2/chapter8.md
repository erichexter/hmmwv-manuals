4. Lubricate O-ring (8) with tire soap and install O-ring (8) on first ledge of rim half (9). Make sure O-
ring (8) is not twisted and is uniformly positioned 1 in. (25.4 mm) below studs (10). Do not overstretch O-ring (8).

5. Position inner rim half (9) on a raised stand (or another inner rim half) to ensure tire (6) sidewall will not contact floor when installed.

6. Lubricate tire bead (7) and rim bead seat areas with tire soap.

Before installing tire on inner rim half, inspect tire sidewalls for a "paint dot". Paint dots are often painted on tires to indicate the tire's light spot, for balancing purposes. If paint dot is present, position tire on rim halves so that paint dot is 180° from valve stem on outer rim half.

7. Center runflat (5) in tire (6). Carefully lower tire (6) over rim half (9). Check to ensure O-ring (8) has not been disturbed.

8. Ensure runflat (5) is not binding flat portion of rim half (9). Runflat (5) should clear inner rim half (9).

9. Install rim half (2) in tire (6).

Tighten locknuts gradually to avoid bent and broken studs, or damage to wheel components.

10. Install rim half (2) to rim half (9) with eight locknuts (1). Tighten locknuts (1) in sequence shown until rim half (2) is nearly touching rim half (9).

11. Tighten locknuts (1) to 55 lb-ft (75 N•m) in sequence shown. 12. Tighten locknuts (1) to 65 lb-ft (88 N•m) in sequence shown. 13. Check wheel assembly for gaps at each stud (10) between rim half (2) and rim half (9). Use a 0.0015 in. (0.038 mm) thickness gauge to detect gaps. If gaps are detected, disassemble and reassemble wheel assembly and recheck for gaps. If gaps are still detected, replace rim half (2).

14. Install valve core (4) in valve stem (3).

- Never inflate a wheel assembly without having checked wheel locknut torques to ensure the wheel locknuts are tightened to specifications. An assembly with improperly tightened locknuts could separate under pressure resulting in serious injury or death.

- Always use a tire inflation cage for inflation purposes. Stand on one side of cage, during inflation, never directly in front. Keep hands out of the cage during inflation. Inflate assembly to recommended pressure, using a clip-on air chuck. Do not exceed 30 psi (207 kPa) cold inflation pressure. Failure to follow these instructions may result in serious injury or death.

15. Place assembly in safety cage and inflate tire (6) to 30 psi (207 kPa) to seat tire bead. 16. Deflate tire (6) to recommended tire pressure (TM 9-2320-280-10). 17. Check for leaks around rim edges (11) and valve stem (4) with soapy solution.

If measurement is larger on rear side of tires than measurement on front side of tires, tires have toe-in.

If toe-out alignment does not meet specifications, repeat checking procedures to eliminate any possible reading errors.

Subtract measurement from rear side of tires (2) step 7, from measurement from front side of tires (2) step 5. The result of this subtraction represents inches of toe-out. Refer to table 8-2 for toeout specifications. If toe-out does not meet specifications, adjust toe-out (task c). Refer to table 8-2 for toe-out adjustment specifications.

8.

9.

If toe-out is within specifications, refer to (task c), and perform step 5.

Vehicles should be at curb weight to ensure proper alignment. Refer to table 8-2(a.) for adjustment specifications. Table 8-2(b.) is optional and can be used when the vehicle's average operation is at less than gross vehicle weight. Vehicle is to be loaded to its average operating weight when using this table.
