[!WARNING]
Exhaust Gases Can Kill

Brain damage or death can result from heavy exposure. Precautions must be followed to ensure crew safety when the personnel heater, main, or auxiliary engine of any vehicle is operated for any purpose.

1. Do not operate your vehicle engine in enclosed areas. 2. Do not idle vehicle engine with vehicle windows closed. 3. Be alert at all times for exhaust odors. 4. Be alert for exhaust poisoning symptoms. they are:
- Headache - Dizziness - Sleepiness - Loss of muscular control 5. If you see another person with exhaust poisoning symptoms:
- Remove person from area - Expose to open air - Keep person warm - Do not permit physical exercise - Administer artificial respiration, if necessary* - Notify a medic
*For artificial respiration, refer to FM 21-11.

6. BE AWARE, the field protective mask for nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) protection will not protect you from carbon monoxide poisoning. THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST EXHAUST POISONING IS ADEQUATE VENTILATION.

# Warning Summary

- Drycleaning solvent is flammable and will not be used near an open flame. A fire extinguisher will be kept nearby when the solvent is used. Use only in well-ventilated places. Failure to do this may result in injury to personnel and/or damage to equipment.

- Compressed air used for cleaning purposes will not exceed 30 psi (207 kPa). Use only with effective chip guarding and personal protective equipment (goggles/shield, gloves, etc.).

- Diesel fuel is highly flammable. Do not perform any procedure near fire, flames, or sparks. Severe injury or death will result.

- Do not touch hot exhaust system components with bare hands. Severe injury will result. - Do not remove surge tank filler cap before releasing internal pressure when engine temperature is above 190°F (88°C). Steam or hot coolant under pressure will cause injury.

- Do not drain oil when engine is hot. Severe injury to personnel will result. - Always wear eye protection when bleeding brakes. Failure to do this may cause injury if brake fluid comes in contact with eyes.

- Remove all jewelry such as rings, dog tags, bracelets, etc. If jewelry or disconnected battery ground cable contacts battery terminal, a direct short will result, causing injury to personnel, or damage to equipment.

- Keep hands and arms away from fan blade and drive belts while engine is running, or serious injury may result.

- Battery acid (electrolyte) is extremely harmful. Always wear safety goggles and rubber gloves, and do not smoke when performing maintenance on batteries. Injury will result if acid contacts eyes or skin.

- When removing battery cable clamps, disconnect ground cable first. Ensure all switches are in OFF
position before disconnecting ground cable. Do not allow tools to come in contact with vehicle when disconnecting cable clamps. A direct short can result, causing instant heating of tools, tool damage, battery damage, or battery explosion.

- Allow transmission/transfer case to cool before performing maintenance. Failure to do this may cause injury.

- Always apply parking brake and chock opposite wheel before removing wheel. Avoid removing wheel when vehicle is on sloping terrain. Injury to personnel or damage to equipment may result.

# Warning Summary (Cont'D)

- Hydraulic jacks are used for raising and lowering, and are not used to support vehicle. Never work under vehicle unless wheels are blocked and it is properly supported. Injury or damage to equipment may result if vehicle suddenly shifts or moves.

- Remove only the inner group of nuts when removing a wheel from the vehicle. Removing the outer nuts which hold the rim together while the assembly is inflated could result in serious injury or death.

- In all disassembly of the wheel assembly operations, ensure the tire is totally deflated before removing wheel nuts. Failure to follow proper safety precautions could cause serious injury or death.

- Never inflate a wheel assembly with the wheel locknuts removed in an attempt to separate inner and outer rim halves. The assembly will separate under pressure resulting in serious injury or death.

- Never use wheel assemblies with studs which are damaged, loose, or have damaged threads. Damaged studs can cause improper assembly, which could cause individual fasteners to fail. Any of these situations could cause serious injury or death.

- Never use tubes in wheel assemblies. Use of a tube defeats built-in-safety features, and could allow the wheel to come apart under pressure, resulting in serious injury or death.

- Use only replacement parts specified in TM 9-2320-280-24P. Wheels assembled with components which do not meet specifications could cause the assembly to separate under pressure, resulting in serious injury or death.

- Never inflate a wheel assembly without having checked wheel locknut torques to ensure the wheel locknuts are tightened to specifications. An assembly with improperly tightened locknuts could separate under pressure resulting in injury or death.

- Always use a tire inflation cage for inflation purposes. Stand on one side of cage, during inflation, never directly in front. Keep hands out of the cage during inflation. Inflate assembly to recommended pressure, using a clip-on air chuck. Do not exceed 30 psi (207 kPa) cold inflation pressure. Failure to follow these instructions may result in serious injury or death.

- Radial tires and bias ply tires should not be mixed on the same vehicle. Injury to personnel or damage to equipment may result.

- Never install radial tire on eight bolt wheel. Damage to equipment may result, causing injury to personnel.

- Ensure that during assembly indexing hole on inner and outer rim halves is aligned. Failure to do so may cause damage to equipment or injury to personnel.

Compressed air used for cleaning purpose will not exceed 30 psi (207 kPa). Use only with effective chip guarding and personnel protective equipment (goggles/shield, gloves, etc.).

Hold nozzle at least one inch away from element (1) and direct compressed air against clean side of element (1) (in direction opposite to normal air flow). Move air stream up and down length of pleats until you can not see dust being blown out.

1.

2.

Prepare a solution of five gallons warm water (80-110° F (26.7-43.3° C)) and approximately one cup of non-sudsing detergent in a container large enough to submerge the element (1). Never use gasoline or solvents of any kind to clean elements. Immerse the element (1) completely in the cleaning solution. Swish for two minutes. Soak the element in the cleaning solution for 15 to 20 minutes, then swish it around again to remove contaminants.

3.

Remove the element (1) from the solution and let it drain.

Rinse the element with cool water (35-80° F (1.7-26.7° C)) from clean side to dirty side (in direction opposite to normal air flow) with a gentle stream of water (no more than 40 psi (275.8 kpa)). If the clean side was contaminated during the soak cycle, rinse the element from both sides.

4.

5.

Air dry the element (1) at normal room temperature until completely dry. Usually overnight is adequate, but temperature and humidity will effect drying time. If you use circulating air, do not exceed 180° F (82.2° C). Do not use compressed air to speed drying time, you will damage your element. Reinspect the element (1) and discard if damaged. If it checks out O.K., mark the date of cleaning on it.

General Safety Instructions
- Wear safety goggles and rubber gloves and do not smoke when performing battery maintenance.

- Remove all jewelry. - When removing battery cables, disconnect ground cable first. Ensure all switches are in OFF position before disconnecting.

- Battery acid (electrolyte) is extremely harmful. Always wear safety goggles and rubber gloves, and do not smoke when performing battery maintenance. Severe injury will result if acid contacts eyes or skin.

- Remove all jewelry such as rings, dogtags, bracelets, etc. If jewelry or disconnected battery ground cable contacts battery terminal, a direct short can result, causing instant heating of tools, severe injury to personnel, or damage to equipment.

- Always disconnect both ground cables when performing battery maintenance on the "A2" series vehicles. The "A2" series vehicles have a 12 volt cable connected to the positive terminal, which keeps the electrical system charged when only one ground cable is disconnected. Failure to do this may cause injury to personnel, or damage to equipment.

- When removing battery cable clamps, disconnect both ground cables first. Ensure all switches are in OFF position before disconnecting. Do not allow tools to come in contact with vehicle when disconnecting cable clamps. A direct short can result, causing instant heating of tools, tool damage, battery damage, or battery explosion.

Always wear eye protection when bleeding brakes.

#### Warnin G

Always wear eye protection when bleeding brakes. Failure to do this may cause injury if brake fluid comes in contact with eyes.

NOT E
If only the front or rear half of the system has been serviced, it is usually necessary to bleed only that half of the system. However, if a firm brake pedal cannot be obtained after bleeding, it will be necessary to bleed the entire system. The brake hydraulic system can be bled manually or by using a pressure tank and adapters. Each method is outlined in the following procedures.

Bleed brakes in the following order: right rear, left rear, right front, left front.

# 7-10. Service Brake System Bleeding Instructions (Cont'D)

a. Pressure Bleeding

When using a pressure bleeding tank, follow the manufacturer's instructions for its use. Do not exceed the recommended working pressure when pressurizing the tank. A tank pressure of 15-20 psi (103, 138 kPa) is sufficient to bleed the brake hydraulic system. Release all air pressure from the tank after using it.

After refilling pressure bleeding tank with silicone brake fluid, let tank sit undisturbed for 30 minutes minimum to ensure all visible as well as minute air bubbles are gone.

NOT E
This procedure covers bleeding at one wheel. Repeat bleeding task for remaining wheels.

Assistant is required to depress the brake pedal when manually bleeding brakes while mechanic opens and closes bleeder screw.

1. Remove protective cap (5) from bleeder screw (6) on caliper assembly (7).

2. Connect short piece of hose (8) to bleeder screw (6), and place other end of hose (8) in container 3/4 full brake fluid.

Check the master cylinder fluid level frequently during the bleeding operation and refill the reservoirs as necessary. Do not allow the master cylinder to run out of fluid at any time, or additional air will be drawn into the system. After adding silicone brake fluid to master cylinder, let cylinder sit undisturbed for 30 minutes minimum to ensure all visible as well as minute air bubbles are gone.

#### B. Toe-Out Check Note

Vehicle must be on level ground with wheels set straight ahead.

Steps 1 through 3 will determine centerline of tire.

"Point of Measurement" for checking toe-out will be where lines marked in steps 1 and 3 intersect.

1.

Mark line (4) on center tread (1) of tire (2) 16-3/2 in. (42 cm) from ground.

2.

Measure total width of tire tread (3) and record.

3.

Mark line (5) on center tread (1) at one-half total tread width (3).

4.

Repeat steps 1 through 3 for opposite tire.

5. 6.

7.

Measure distance between "Points of Measurement" on front side of tires (2) and record. Rotate tires (2) by moving vehicle forward until "Points of Measurement" are 16-1/2 in. (42 cm)
above the ground at rear side of tires (2).

Measure distance between "Points of Measurement" on rear side of tires (2) and record.

NOTE
If measurement is larger on rear side of tires than measurement on front side of tires, tires have toe-in.

If toe-out alignment does not meet specifications, repeat checking procedures to eliminate any possible reading errors.

Subtract measurement from rear side of tires (2) step 7, from measurement from front side of tires (2) step 5. The result of this subtraction represents inches of toe-out. Refer to table 8-2 for toeout specifications. If toe-out does not meet specifications, adjust toe-out (task c). Refer to table 8-2 for toe-out adjustment specifications.
