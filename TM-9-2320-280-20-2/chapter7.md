#### Warnin G

Always wear eye protection when bleeding brakes. Failure to do this may cause injury if brake fluid comes in contact with eyes.

 Note
If only the front or rear half of the system has been serviced, it is usually necessary to bleed only that half of the system. However, if a firm brake pedal cannot be obtained after bleeding, it will be necessary to bleed the entire system. The brake hydraulic system can be bled manually or by using a pressure tank and adapters. Each method is outlined in the following procedures.

Bleed brakes in the following order: right rear, left rear, right front, left front.

# 7-10. Service Brake System Bleeding Instructions (Cont'D)

a. Pressure Bleeding

When using a pressure bleeding tank, follow the manufacturer's instructions for its use. Do not exceed the recommended working pressure when pressurizing the tank. A tank pressure of 15-20 psi (103, 138 kPa) is sufficient to bleed the brake hydraulic system. Release all air pressure from the tank after using it.

After refilling pressure bleeding tank with silicone brake fluid, let tank sit undisturbed for 30 minutes minimum to ensure all visible as well as minute air bubbles are gone.

 Note
This procedure covers bleeding at one wheel. Repeat bleeding task for remaining wheels.
