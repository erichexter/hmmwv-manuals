# Technical Manuals for the HMMWV Platform

This is an attempt to convert the origional Militarty Technical Manuals to an online version that has better index and navigation between procedures. So that it is better accessed via phones and tablets. This is an open source project, so if you are inclined you can submit changes to help make it better, or just report any issues to the project here: https://github.com/erichexter/hmmwv-manuals/discussions
