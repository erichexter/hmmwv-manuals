# Warning Exhaust Gases Can Kill

Brain damage or death can result from heavy exposure. Precautions must be followed to ensure crew safety when the personnel heater, main, or auxiliary engine of any vehicle is operated for any purpose.

1. Do not operate your vehicle engine in enclosed areas. 2. Do not idle vehicle engine with vehicle windows closed. 3. Be alert at all times for exhaust odors. 4. Be alert for exhaust poisoning symptoms:
- Headache - Dizziness - Sleepiness - Loss of muscular control 5. If you see another person with exhaust poisoning symptoms:
- Remove person from area - Expose to open air - Keep person warm - Do not permit physical exercise - Administer artificial respiration, if necessary* - Notify a medic
*For artificial respiration, refer to FM 21-11.

6. BE AWARE, the field protective mask for Nuclear, Biological, or Chemical (NBC) protection will not protect you from carbon monoxide poisoning. THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST EXHAUST POISONING IS ADEQUATE VENTILATION.

# Warning Summary

- Drycleaning solvent is flammable and will not be used near an open flame. A fire extinguisher will be kept nearby when the solvent is used. Use only in well-ventilated places. Failure to do this may result in injury to personnel and/or damage to equipment.

- Compressed air used for cleaning purposes will not exceed 30 psi (207 kPa). Use only with effective chip guarding and personal protective equipment (goggles/shield, gloves, etc.).

- Diesel fuel is highly flammable. Do not perform any procedure near fire, flames, or sparks. Severe injury or death will result.

- Do not touch hot exhaust system components with bare hands. Severe injury will result. - Do not remove surge tank filler cap before releasing internal pressure when engine temperature is above 185°F (85°C). Steam or hot coolant under pressure will cause injury.

- Do not drain oil when engine is hot. Severe injury to personnel will result. - Always wear eye protection when bleeding brakes. Failure to do this may cause injury if brake fluid comes in contact with eyes.

- Do not perform battery system checks or inspections while smoking or near fire, flames, or sparks.

Batteries may explode, causing damage to vehicle, injury, or death to personnel.

- Remove all jewelry such as rings, dog tags, bracelets, etc. If jewelry or disconnected battery ground cable contacts battery terminal, a direct short will result, causing injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- Use caution when testing thermostat. Hot water will cause burns. - Negative battery cable must be disconnected before disconnecting any harness from protective control box or serious injury to personnel or damage to equipment will result.

- Keep hands and arms away from fan blade and drivebelts while engine is running or serious injury may result.

- Battery acid (electrolyte) is extremely harmful. Always wear safety goggles and rubber gloves, and do not smoke when performing maintenance on batteries. Injury will result if acid contacts eyes or skin.

- When removing battery cable clamps, disconnect ground cable first. Ensure all switches are in OFF position before disconnecting ground cable. Do not allow tools to come in contact with vehicle when disconnecting cable clamps. A direct short can result, causing instant heating of tools, tool damage, battery damage, or battery explosion.

- Allow transmission/transfer case to cool before performing maintenance. Failure to do this may cause injury.

- Always apply parking brake and chock opposite wheel before removing wheel. Avoid removing wheel when vehicle is on sloping terrain. Injury to personnel or damage to equipment may result.

- Gloves must be worn whenever handling winch cable. Severe injury may result. - Hydraulic jacks are used for raising and lowering, and are not used to support vehicle. Never work under vehicle unless wheels are blocked and it is properly supported. Injury or damage to equipment may result if vehicle suddenly shifts or moves.

- Remove only the inner group of nuts when removing a wheel from the vehicle. Removing the outer nuts which hold the rim together while the assembly is inflated could result in serious injury or death.

- In all disassembly of the wheel assembly operations, ensure the tire is totally deflated before removing wheel nuts. Failure to follow proper safety precautions could cause serious injury or death.

- Never inflate a wheel assembly with the wheel locknuts removed in an attempt to separate inner and outer rim halves. The assembly will separate under pressure, resulting in serious injury or death.

# Warning Summary **(Cont'D)**

- Never use wheel assemblies with studs which are damaged, loose, or have damaged threads. Damaged studs can cause improper assembly, which could cause individual fasteners to fail. Any of these situations could cause serious injury or death.

- Never use tubes in wheel assemblies. Use of a tube defeats built-in safety features, and could allow the wheel to come apart under pressure, resulting in serious injury or death.

- Use only replacement parts specified in TM 9-2320-387-24P. Wheels assembled with components which do not meet specifications could cause the assembly to separate under pressure, resulting in serious injury or death.

- Never inflate a wheel assembly without having checked wheel locknut torques that ensure that wheel locknuts are tightened to specifications. An assembly with improperly tightened locknuts could separate under pressure, resulting in serious injury or death.

- Always use an OSHA approved tire inflation cage for inflation purposes. Stand on one side of cage during inflation; never directly in front. Keep hands out of the cage during inflation. Inflate assembly to recommended pressure using a clip-on air chuck. Do not exceed 30 psi (207 kPa) cold bias tire inflation pressure or 50 psi (344 kPa) cold radial tire inflation pressure. Failure to follow these instructions may result in serious injury or death.

- NBC contaminated filters must be handled and disposed of only by authorized and trained personnel.

The unit commander or senior officer in charge of maintenance personnel must ensure that prescribed protective clothing (FM 3-4) is used, and prescribed safety measures and decontamination procedures (FM 3-5) are followed. The local unit SOP is responsible for final disposal of contaminated air filters. Failure to do this may cause severe injury to personnel.

- Seatbelts are to be replaced as a set. Failure to do this may cause injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- The Department of Transportation requires 105 mm cannon ammunition to be in wooden boxes when transporting ammunition on public highways, by fixed wing aircraft, rail, or ship. Movement of cannon ammunition in fiber containers (inner pack) in the HMMWV ammunition rack is restricted to other than public highways.

- Air-conditioning system must be discharged prior to replacing components. Failure to do this may result in injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- Ensure all slack from the three-point seatbelt or Improved Personal Restraint System is removed. The three-point seatbelt and Improved Personal Restraint System will lock only during sudden stops or impact. Injury and/or death to personnel may result if an accident occurs and seatbelts or lap and shoulder straps are not in use or adjusted properly.

- Protective eye equipment (goggles/shield) must be worn when removing snaprings or springs. Failure to comply may result in injury to personnel.

- Ensure automatic fire extinguishing system (AFES) anti-recoil device is installed in place of deflector valve.

Failure to do so can result in discharge of liquid and powder agents can cause injury to personnel.

- Vehicle armor is extremely heavy and must be supported during removal and installation. Failure to do so may result in injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

# Using Your Manual: An Example

a. TASKz The operator of an ECV vehicle has complained that his carrier uses too much engine oil. The vehicle has been assigned to you for repair. 

## B. Troubleshooting Steps:

L Look at the cover of this manual. You'll see chapter titles listed from top to bottom on the right-hand side. 

2. Look at the right edge of the manual. On some of the pages you'll see black bars 
(bleed-to-edge indicators) that are aligned with the chapter bars on the cover. These are the locations of the chapters in the text. 

![51_image_0.png](51_image_0.png)

3. Look for SERVICE AND TROUBLESHOOTING INSTRUCTIONS in the chapter list on the cover. 

This is where the troubleshooting information is located. 

4. Turn to those pages with the edge indicator matching the black bar for service and troubleshooting instructions. Page numbers are also listed next to chapter titles. 

5. Chapter 2 is divided into five sections: 
l Section I - Repair Parts, Special Tools, TMDE, and Support Equipment l Section II - Service Upon Receipt l Section III - PMCS l Section IV - General Maintenance Instructions l Section V - Electrical/Mechanical Systems Troubleshooting 6. Turn to section V, ELECTRICAL 

![52_image_0.png](52_image_0.png)

MECHANICAL SYSTEMS TROUBLE- SHOOTING (page 2-33). This troubleshooting section is systemoriented and is broken down into five top level tests and nineteen system level tests. 

7. One of the first pages of this section is the 

![52_image_1.png](52_image_1.png)

ELECTRICAL/MECHANICAL SYSTEM 
TROUBLESHOOTING (turn to page 2-35). 

8. Look down the list of symptoms until you find ENGINE LUBRICATION TESTS. In that paragraph you will find the diagnostic flow chart from which the vehicle operator can choose the test such as OIL LEAKS OR ENGINE PROBLEMS. 

9. Turn to the test indicated. 

10. On page 2-192, steps relating to 

![53_image_0.png](53_image_0.png)

resolving the problem of excessive oil loss are listed. Read the diagnostic flow chart until you find OIL LEAKS OR ENGINE PROBLEMS. The tests listed are shown in the example page to the right of this text. 

IL In accordance with Test 1, you checked the oil level and filter for leaks. The oil level and filter appears normal and you move on to Test 2. 

12. In Test 2, you begin a methodic check of the engine lubricating system. You discover a leak in the oil cooler assembly adjacent to one of the mounting brackets. One of the welds has cracked, allowing a class III leak from a small area of the cooling fins. The oil cooler assembly must be repaired or replaced. 

13. At this point, the engine lubrication diagnostic flow chart would direct you to a specific detailed procedure to solve the problem. However, the engine lubricating system is complex and you must now refer to the table of contents to locate the proper task paragraph. 

NOTE: Before attempting to repair or replace the oil cooler assembly, as a Unit mechanic, you must: 
a. Determine the maintenance responsibility of repair or replacement of the component. b. If **the** task is at your echelon of maintenance responsibility, you must identify the tools needed and the replacement parts required. 

Refer to the Maintenance Allocation Chart - MAC (appendix B) to determine not only the maintenance responsibility of the item, but also to obtain an estimate of the time required to perform the task, tools needed, and any special notes/requirements necessary. 

Refer to TM 9-2320-387-24P, Unit, Direct Support and General Support Maintenance Repair Parts and Special Tools List for requisition data concerning replacement parts for this task. 

![54_image_0.png](54_image_0.png)

#### C. Oil Cooler Assembly

REPLACEMENT: After reporting the results of your troubleshooting efforts to your supervisor, he decides that the most expedient means of returning the vehicle to service would be to replace the oil cooler assembly. 

L Turn to the TABLE OF CONTENTS and find the chapter dealing with the engine. You find it as CHAPTER 3, ENGINE SYSTEMS 
(UNIT) MAINTENANCE. Furthermore, you note that the chapter is divided into five sections. You are interested in Section I. 

Lubrication System Maintenance. 

2. Turn to chapter 3, section I on page 3-1. Here you find the Lubrication System Maintenance Task Summary. Read down the list of tasks until you find the one that will correct your maintenance problem. For our example, you find it as task 3-8, Engine, Transmission, and Power Steering Oil Cooler Assembly Maintenance. Turn to page 3-12. 

![55_image_0.png](55_image_0.png)

3. Un page 3-12, you find paragraph 3-8 with the detailed procedure for replacing the oil cooler assembly 
- - 

d. DETAILED MAINTE NANCE PROCEDURES: Detailed maintenance procedures include everything you must do to accomplish a basic maintenance task. Unless otherwise stated, general mechanic's automotive tool kit will be used for maintenance of this vehicle. 

L Before beginning the maintenance task, look through the procedure. You must familiarize yourself with the entire maintenance procedure of para. 3-8: Engine, 'D-ansmission, and Power Steering Oil Cooler Assembly Maintenance. The task includes a. Removal, b. Installation, and c. Cleaning and Inspection. 

2. The ten basic headings listed under INITIAL SETUP outline task conditions, materials, special tools, manpower requirements, and special conditions. The headings are: 

ADDlicable Models: Any models that require a particular maintenance task. If a maintenance task covers all models, then this heading will not be used. Test Eauinment: Test equipment needed to complete a task. If test equipment is not required, this heading will not be used. 

Tools: These are common tools and general mechanic tool sets required to perform maintenance tasks. These common tools should be on hand to properly perform the task. Torque wrenches are required for many tasks; the proper torque wrench should be available to tighten mounting hardware. SDecial Tools: Those special tools needed to complete a maintenance task. If no special tools are needed, this heading will not be used.

1-17. PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION REFERENCE INDEX

# 1-18. Drivetrain Operation

The drivetrain is identical for both models covered in this manual. It converts horsepower into mechanical force to move the vehicle. Major components of the drivetrain are:
A **ENGINE** - The 6.5 liter V-8 turbocharged engine develops approximately 190 horsepower at 3,400 rpm to power the vehicle. The engines are essentially the same on all models except those equipped with deep water fording kit installed, which adds a specially vented CDR valve. This difference does not affect engine performance.

B
TRANSMISSION - Adapts engine power to meet different driving conditions. The automatic transmission has four forward speeds, a reverse, a neutral, and a park. A neutral safety switch prevents the vehicle from being started with the transmission in any selector lever position except park and neutral.

C
TRANSFER CASE - Directs engine-to-transmission power to front and rear differentials simultaneously. This condition means the vehicle is always in four-wheel drive. The transfer case allows for selection of three drive ranges and a neutral position. A complete description of these driving ranges and the recommended driving conditions during which they are used can be found in TM 9-2320-387-10. PROPELLER SHAFTS - Link transfer case to differentials. Universal joints, located at either end of the front and rear propeller shafts, permit inline driving power between the transfer case and differentials even though they are mounted at different angles. DIFFERENTIALS - Transmit driving power, via halfshafts and geared hubs, to left and right wheels. The differential ensures power is applied to the wheel having traction, regardless of which wheel is slipping. This feature is called torque biasing.

F
HALFSHAFTS - Transmit power from differentials to geared hubs.

# 2-6. General Inspection And Servicing Instructions

The following steps should be taken while performing general inspection and services:

Protective eye equipment (goggles/shield) must be worn when removing snaprings or springs. Failure to comply may result in injury to personnel.

Cooler fin and engine protective covers can be used to prevent damage to the vehicle components during maintenance. Refer to appendix D, figures D-40 and D-41 for fabrication instructions.

(1) Use TM 9-2320-387-10 as well as other sections of this manual when servicing and inspecting equipment.

Drycleaning solvent is flammable and will not be used near an open flame. A fire extinguisher will be kept nearby when the solvent is used. Use only in well-ventilated places. Failure to do this may result in injury to personnel and/or damage to equipment.

(2) Clean all exterior surfaces coated with rust-preventive compounds. Use drycleaning solvent
(appendix C, item 26).

(3) Clean fittings before lubrication. Clean parts with drycleaning solvent (SD), type II, or equivalent.

Dry before lubricating. Relubricate all items found contaminated after fording.

(4) Inspect electrical connectors for corrosion and/or damage (i.e., bent pins). Clean and repair damage. Apply sealing compound (appendix C, item 60) before reconnecting plugs.

(5) Read Processing and Deprocessing Record of Shipping, Storage, and Issue of Vehicles and Spare Engines, tag (DD Form 1397) and follow all precautions listed. This tag should be attached to steering wheel, steering column, or rotary switch.

# 2-7. Specific Inspection And Servicing Instructions

The following steps should be taken while performing specific inspections and services:
(1) Do the semiannual preventive maintenance checks and services listed in section III in this chapter.

(2) Lubricate the vehicle. Do not lubricate gear cases and engine unless processing tag states that the oil is unsuitable for 500 mi (805 km) operation. If oil is suitable, just check level.

(3) Schedule semiannual service on DD Form 314 (Preventive Maintenance Schedule and Record Card).

(4) If vehicle is delivered with a dry, charged battery, activate it according to TM 9-6140-200-14. (5) Check vehicle coolant level and determine if solution is proper for climate (refer to TB 750-651 for preparation of antifreeze solutions).

(6) Remove towing brackets from their stowed position behind the bumper and install them in their proper location (para. 9-2).

# Section Iii. Preventive Maintenance Checks And Services

# 2-8. General

The army has an agreement with the door manufacturer to issue free patch kits to repair armor doors that exhibit cracks originating from the window area (M1114 doors only). If you find cracks that extend 1.25 in. (31.75 mm) from either side or 6.25 in. (158.75 mm) below the window opening, contact TACOM, Light Truck Group, AMSTA-LC- CHLA, Warren, MI 48397-5000 at DSN 786-4389 or Commercial 586574-3806, or E-mail uparmoredhmmwv@tacom.army.mil for guidance on obtaining a kit.

The best way to maintain vehicles covered by this manual is to inspect them on a regular basis so minor faults can be discovered and corrected before they result in serious damage, failure, or injury. All intervals are based on normal operation. Hard time intervals may be shortened if lubricants are contaminated or if you are operating the equipment under adverse conditions, including longer-than-usual operating hours. Hard-time intervals may be extended during periods of low activity, though adequate preservation precautions must be taken. This section contains systematic instructions of inspection, adjustment, lubrication, and correction of vehicle components to avoid costly repairs or major breakdowns. This is Preventive Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS).

# 2-9. Intervals

a. Unit maintenance, assisted by operator/crew, will perform checks and services contained in table 2-1 at the following intervals:
(1) Semiannually. Every 6 months or 3,000 miles (4,828 km), whichever comes first. (2) Annually. Every 12 months or 6,000 miles (9,656 km), whichever comes first. (3) Biennially. Every 24 months or 12,000 miles (19,310 km), whichever comes first.

b. Refer to following steps when performing lubrication checks and services:
(1) Intervals. Lubrication services coincide with the vehicle's semiannual preventive maintenance service. For this purpose, a 10% tolerance (variation) in specified lubrication point mileage is permissible. Those vehicles not accumulating 1,000 mi (1,609 km) in a 6-month period will be lubricated at the time of semiannual preventive maintenance service.

(2) For Operation of Equipment in Protracted Cold Temperatures Below -15°F (-26°C).

Remove lubricants prescribed in lubrication table for temperatures above -15°F (-26°C). Relubricate with lubricants specified in lubrication table for temperatures below -15°F (-26°C). If OEA lubricant is required, see the temperature ranges prescribed in the lubrication table. OEA lubricant is to be used in place of OE/HDO 10 lubricant for all temperature ranges where OE/HDO 10 is specified in the lubrication table.

c. Perform all semiannual inspections in addition to annual inspections at the time of the annual inspection. Perform all annual and semiannual inspections in addition to biennial inspections at the time of the biennial inspection.

# 2-10. Reporting Repairs

All vehicle shortcomings will be reported on DA form 2404 (DA Pam 750-8), Equipment Inspection and Maintenance Worksheet, immediately after the PMCS, and before taking corrective action. All vehicle deficiencies will be reported in the equipment record.

# 2-11. General Service And Inspection Procedures

a. While performing specific PMCS procedures, ensure items are correctly assembled, secure, not worn, serviceable, not leaking, and adequately lubricated as defined below:
(1) An item is CORRECTLY ASSEMBLED when it is in proper position and all parts are present. (2) When wires, nuts, washers, hoses, or attaching hardware cannot be moved by hand, they are SECURE.

(3) An item is WORN if there is too much play between joining parts or when marking data, warning, and caution plates are not readable.

(4) An item is UNSERVICEABLE if it is worn beyond repair and is likely to fail before the next scheduled inspection.

(5) LEAKS. TM 9-2320-387-10 contains definitions of class I, II, and III leaks and their effect on vehicle operation.

(6) If an item meets the specified lubrication requirements, then it is ADEQUATELY LUBRICATED.

b. Where the instruction tighten appears in a procedure, you must tighten with a wrench to the given torque value even when the item appears to be secure.

Drycleaning solvent is flammable and will not be used near an open flame. A fire extinguisher will be kept nearby when the solvent is used. Use only in well-ventilated places. Failure to do this may result in injury to personnel and/or damage to equipment.

c. Where the instruction clean appears in a procedure, you must use drycleaning solvent (appendix C,
item 26) to clean grease or oil from metal parts. After the item is cleaned, rinsed, and dried, apply a light grade of oil to unprotected surfaces to prevent rusting.

d. Clean rubber and plastic materials with soap and water. Refer to TM 9-2320-387-10 for general vehicle cleaning instructions.

# 2-12. Specific Pmcs Procedures

a. The preventive maintenance for which you are responsible is provided in table 2-1. The checks and services listed are arranged in logical order, requiring minimal time and effort on your part.

b. The following columns read across on the PMCS schedule:
(1) Item Number. Provides logical order of PMCS performance and is used as a source number for DA Form 2404, on which your PMCS results will be recorded.

(2) Interval. Shows the interval next to each item number to indicate when that check is to be performed. The interval will be repeated when consecutive item numbers are to be inspected during the same interval. Interval columns include:
(a) Semiannual (six month) checks; (b) Annual (yearly) checks; and (c) Biennial (every two years) checks.

(3) Item To Be Inspected. Lists the system, common name, or location of the item to be inspected. (4) Procedures. Provides instructions for servicing, inspection, lubrication, replacement, or adjustment and, in some cases, having item repaired at a higher level.

Always do your preventive maintenance checks and services in the order prepared. Once it gets to be a habit, you will be able to spot anything wrong in a hurry.

(5) Not Fully Mission Capable If. If vehicle meets criteria in this column, vehicle is Not Mission Capable (NMC).

(2) Check for dirt in lubrication holes or grooves. Holes and grooves must be clean and free from damage.

e. Machined Parts.

(1) Check machined parts for cracks, distortion, and damage. (2) Check all surfaces for nicks, burrs, and raised metal.

f. Studs, Bolts, Capscrews, and Nuts. Replace if bent, loose, stretched, or threads are damaged. g. Gears.

When gear teeth wear limits are not established, good judgment is required to determine if gear replacement is necessary.

(1) Inspect all gears for cracks and missing teeth. Replace if cracked or teeth are missing. (2) Inspect gear teeth for wear, sharp fins, burrs, and galled or pitted surfaces. (3) Inspect splines for wear, burrs, and galled or pitted surfaces. (4) Check keyway slots for wear and/or damage.

h. Oil Seals. Oil seals are mandatory replacement items. i. Casting Plugs. Inspect for leakage. Replace plugs when leakage is present. j. Springs. Inspect for damaged, distorted, and collapsed coils. k. Snaprings, Retaining Rings, and Washers. Many of these parts are mandatory replacement items. Inspect all others for obvious damage.

# 2-16. Repair

a. General Instructions. Repair of most parts and components is limited to general procedures outlined in applicable maintenance instructions and the following detailed procedures b through g.

Repaired items must be thoroughly cleaned to remove metal chips and abrasives to prevent them from entering working parts of vehicle components.

## B. Castings.

(1) All cracked castings will be replaced. (2) Only minor repairs to machined surfaces, flanges, and gasket mating surfaces are permitted.

Remove minor nicks, burrs, and/or scratches by:
(a) Using fine mill file. (b) Using abrasive cloth dipped in cleaning solvent. (c) Lapping across a surface plate. (d) Remachining of machined surfaces to repair damage, warpage, or uneven surfaces is not permitted. Replace castings.

(3) Repair damaged threaded pipe plug and/or capscrew holes with a thread tap, or repair oversize holes with threaded inserts.

## 2-16. Repair (Cont'D)

d. Studs. Replace all bent and stretched studs. Repair minor thread damage with a thread restorer file. 

Replace studs having stripped or damaged threads as outlined below: 
(11 Remove using a stud remover. Back studs out slowly to avoid heat buildup and seizure which can cause stud to break off. 

(2) If studs break off too short to use a stud remover, use extractor to remove. 

(3) Replacement studs have a special coating and must have a small amount of antiseize compound 
(appendix C, item 161 applied on threads before stud is installed. Install replacement stud slowly to prevent heat buildup and snapping off. 

e. Gears. 

(11 Remove gears using pullers, as required. (21 Use the same methods described in procedure b, step 2 for castings to remove minor nicks, burrs, or scratches on gear teeth. 

(31 If keyways are worn or enlarged, replace gear. 

f. Bushings and Bushing-Type Bearings. When bushings and bushing-type bearings seize to a shaft and spin in the bore, the associated part must also be inspected and replaced, as required. 

g. Oil Seals. 

(11 Remove oil seals being careful not to damage casting or adapter bore. 

(21 Always install new seal in bore using proper seal-replacing tool.

PCB - Protective Control Box, located on the firewall above the brake pedal. 

STE/ICE-R - Simplified Test Equipment for Internal Combustion Engines - Reprogrammable, a testing system used for performing tests and measurements on the vehicle. In addition to acting as a conventional digital multimeter to measure voltage, current, and resistance, it is also capable of measuring pressure, speed,.compression unbalance, engine power, and some specialized battery and starter evaluations. It is powered from the vehicle batteries. The complete system includes a vehicle test meter (VTM), a transducer kit (TK), cables, transit case, and technical publications. DCA - Diagnostic Connector Assembly, an electrical harness on the vehicle which allows the STE/ICE-R 
to be powered and to make measurements of key vehicle signals from a single connection. In addition to many basic electrical signals such as starter voltage and current, it includes engine speed and fuel supply pressure. The STE/ICE-R can make TK measurements at the same time that it is connected to the DCA. 

VTM - Vehicle Test Meter, a box which performs the measurement and analysis functions of the STE/ICE-R systems. 

TK (and TK mode) - Transducer Kit, a collection of transducers, adapters, and fittings which permit the STE/ICE-R to be used as a general purpose measurement system for any application. This allows the STE/ICE-R to be used anywhere that you want to measure voltage, current, resistance, pressure, or speed. TK mode of operation is what you are doing when you use this kit (as opposed to DCA mode where you are using the vehicle's built-in sensors to make measurements). 

Compression unbalance - A STE/ICE-R test that gives an indication of any engine cylinders that have lower compression then the average. It does this by monitoring the battery voltage during cranking. As each cylinder goes into compression, the extra load on the starter shows up as a drop in voltage. This works well for finding one or more cylinders that have a compression problem, but don't forget that it doesn't give the average compression. If all cylinders are low by the same amount, this test doesn't find it. 

Troubleshooting - The process of making measurements and observing the operation of the vehicle to find out if anything is wrong with it and then to locate any problem that exists. 

Diagnostics - Troubleshooting by following an exact procedure. 

Test Chain - A series of tests to be followed in a particular order or sequence. It is referred to as a 'chain" of tests because they are all connected one after another like the links of a chain. 

System - A collection of devices which are all related to each other because they depend on each other to do some function or job. For instance, the function of the fuel system is to inject fuel into the cylinders at the correct time in the correct amount and with the correct quality. The collection of devices that are required to do this include the fuel pump, fuel lines, lift pump, fuel filter, injection pump, and injectors. 

# 12-21. Glossary Of Abbreviations And Commonly Used Terms (Cont'D) 1

Functional flow schematic - A diagram which is much like a normal electrical circuit diagram, except that its purpose is to show the flow of information through the system (or the flow of a signal or the flow of some material such as the fuel). This kind of diagram shows how each component or device depends on the others. It is called functional flow because it shows the function (purpose of each component) and how the output of one component flows into the next. For troubleshooting, the functional flow schematic is better than the usual circuit diagram because it allows you to quickly see how the system works and what to expect when you make measurements on a system that has faults. You can't expect the output of a device to be good when it has a bad input. 

## 12-22. Electric Circuit Description

An electrical circuit is a collection of electrical devices which are connected in a loop from a positive voltage source (the battery positive) to a negative source ( the battery negative). It must be continuous, with no breaks (no opening in the loop) so that electrical current can flow from the positive to the negative. You can think of it like the plumbing in your house. There must be a source of water under pressure or nothing will flow through the pipes. Water pressure is like the positive voltage of the battery. There may be branches (tees) in the pipes going to several different places, but if you don't connect the pipes, you don't get water. The same thing is true with the electrical circuit. If the wires aren't connected, no electricity will flow through them. 

In the plumbing of a house, all of the water must go to the drain (you won't permit it to be spilled on the floor). With the vehicle electrical circuit, the drain is the negative terminal of the battery. With the water pipes, the water always flows from high pressure to low pressure (another way of saying that water always flows downhill). The electrical current is the same as the water flow - it always goes from positive to negative voltage. Voltage is to electricity what pressure is to water. Just like the pressure in the water pipe, the greater the voltage, the more electricity will flow through the wires. Unlike the water pipes that will spill the water if they break, you can't spill the electricity. The closest thing to this in an electrical circuit is when two wires touch that aren't supposed to and the current flows to some place that it shouldn't (this is called a short circuit or a short). Shorts often happen where the wire touches the vehicle body (the body is connected to the negative terminal of the battery). Since the current always flows through the easiest path to negative, it will bypass the rest of the circuit where it was supposed to go, and go through the short directiy to the battery. Because this new path to the battery negative is shorter, the malfunction is called a short circuit or a short. 

If you put a valve in a water pipe, you can control how much water flows by closing the valve. What you are doing is pinching off the pipe with the valve which restricts the flow. if you shut it off completely, you can stop all water from flowing. In the electrical circuit, a resistor acts like a valve. If you make the resistor extremely large, you can stop the current from flowing. The resistance is measured in ohms. 

## 1 2-22. Electric Circuit Description (Cont'D)

When there is no electrical connection, such as when a wire is disconnected, the resistance is infinite (too large to be measured). No current will flow through the wires, because the circuit is no longer continuously connected. This is referred to as an open circuit or simply an open. Remember that an electrical circuit is formed by continuous loops of devices connected together. When you are troubleshooting, you are often asked to check for continuity, which simply means that you need to find out if there is a continuous path from one place in the circuit to another. Since you are trying to see if the path is continuous, you must check wires and switches rather than any special or active devices. You will usually just measure the resistance between two points. If the resistance is zero (or the value of any resistance that is supposed to be there), then there is continuity. In the case of looking for a short, this may mean that you have found the short. If the resistance is off-scale on the meter (infinite resistance) then there is no connection and you have found an open. A continuity test is the same whether you are looking for an open or a short, the only difference being what resistance values you are looking for and where you make the measurements. 

You are familiar with the typical light switch which allows you to turn a light on and off. A switch of any kind in an electrical circuit is simply a way of opening the loop so that no current will flow through it. 

Something to remember while troubleshooting is that everything on the positive side of the switch still has full battery voltage while everything from the switch on through the rest of the circuit is (or should be) connected to the battery negative terminal and you will measure zero volts. This is easy to remember if you think of the faucet on a sink. If you shut off the faucet, there is no water flowing into the sink, but the water in the pipe is still under pressure. Sometimes a switch is turned on and off automatically. An example is a circuit breaker, which is a device that measures how much current is flowing through it. If the current goes too high (possibly damaging equipment or melting the wires), then it opens an internal switch to stop the current flow. A relay is another form of switch that is turned on and off under remote control using a signal in another wire. When a device which requires a very large amount of current (such as the starter motor) must be turned on and off, a power relay is used. The idea is to use a small switch to turn on a larger switch. Thus, you don't have very large wires going all over the vehicle or large switches on the instrument panel. In the case of the starter's power relay, it is also called a solenoid. A solenoid is any device that changes the electrical current into a forward and backward motion. It is something like an electrical motor except that instead of continuously going around in the same direction, it goes in or out. For the starter, the solenoid is used to push a very large switch into the ON position. 

When testing a circuit, you will need to know how much current is flowing. Current is easily measured with the STOICE-FL A device called a shunt is connected to the negative terminal of the battery. A shunt is a very precise resistor designed so that for every 1,000 amps of current that flow through it, there is a drop of .1 volt from one side to the other (different shunts may have different values). By measuring the voltage across the shunt, you know how much current is flowing through the circuit. The shunt is placed on the negative side because it is safer (less chance of accidents which may short out the batteries). Since all of the current eventually goes through the negative battery terminal anyway, the shunt gives the same measurement as if it were connected to the positive terminal. You can think of the shunt as doing the same thing as the water meter in your house. As you turn devices such as lights on or off, you can use the shunt to measure how much current they are using.

# 12-23. Startability Tests I

This is a top level test for problems with an engine that doesn't start, or starts but immediately stops, or is very hard to start. If the engine starts but doesn't run well after starting, try the STARTABILITY tests first. 

FOR THE ENGINE TO START, ALL OF THE BASIC SYSTEMS SHOWN BELOW 
MUST BE WORKING. THESE STARTABILITY TESTS WILL HELP YOU TO 
VERIFY THE CONDITION OF EACH OF THESE SYSTEMS.

A functional flow schematic is not applicable to this section. 

However, so that you may refer to sections as you need them, a quick index to the systems required for starting is given here.

## Reference Information

STARTABILITY 
Make sure all of the vehicle's fluids are at the proper level. 

You could still have battery or starter problems with a cranking speed over 100 rpm. but that shouldn't stop the engine from starting. Tests for the battery and starter can be run separately, if you want to run them.

STARTABILITY

# Reference Information

![168_image_0.png](168_image_0.png)

A HOT ENGINE MAY CAUSE SERIOUS
BURNS. Always use caution when approaching a hot engine.

NOTE
When using the vehicle's temperature gage to determine engine temperature, don't forget to turn the rotary switch to "RUN". The gages don't work when power is off.

The colder the engine (and air temperature),
the more you need the glow plugs for starting.

There are some times when you don't need to run the glow plugs test. If the engine is warm and the problem is there on a hot day, then the problem is probably NOT the glow plugs or cold start advance, and these tests may be bypassed. If it's colder than 50°F, run the glow plugs test, because iust a few bad glow plugs can make a minor starting problem much worse.

If the vehicle passes the STE/ICE-R
compression unbalance test, it may still have a compression problem, but it would mean that every cylinder has low compression. This is possible, but not too likely. If you're confident that everything else is working properly, notify DS maintenance.

## Compression Unbalance Steace-R Test 14

1. Run lests 72,73 and 74 to verify that the batteries are OK
CAUTION
THE GLOW PLUGS CONTROLLER AND THE CONTROL VALVE ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR MUST BE DISCONNECTED PRIOR TO TUNNING THIS TEST.

2. Disconnect wire 54A at injection pump to prevent starting.

3. Disconnect glow plugs controller and control valve electrical connector. (to keep waveform clean).

4. Start Test 14, compression unbalance.

5. Wait for the GO message. Crank the engine. 6. Release the rotary switch when the VTM
displays OFF. A number less than 25%
is passing.

# Reference Information Startability

During high temperature and humidity, early model vehicles can experience difficulty starting while using JP-8 fuel. High temperatures can cause restrictive clearances in some older fuel injection head and rotor assemblies. The engine must be allowed to cool to allow adequate clearance of the pumping plungers to ensure adequate fuel delivery for starting. If this condition persists, run the startability tests. If vehicle passes all startability tests and troubleshooting procedures and still experiences difficulty in hot starting, identify the fuel injection pump and serial numbers. All fuel injection pumps with P/N DB2831-5209 incorporated the improved head and rotor assembly, P/N 31506. If your serial number is less than shown in the Serial Number Break Column of the table below, the manufacturer recommends the fuel injection pump to be replaced, tagged as a "no hot restart" condition, and forward for rebuild. Notify direct support maintenance.

## 2-24. Engine Running Tests

This is a top level test for problems with an engine that starts but doesn't run well after starting. This includes an engine that starts but doesn't stay running for very long. If the engine doesn't start, or starts but immediately stops, or is very hard to start, try the STARTABILITY tests first. 

A functional flow schematic is not applicable to this section. 

However, so that you may refer to sections as you need them, a quick index to the systems relating to engine running is given here.

I 
It is normal for the engine to emit some black smoke when accelerating after idling for a while. Under most other conditions, exhaust smoke is usually from one of three sources; I 
BLUE smoke is usually oil. BLACK smoke is too much fuel or too little air (often caused by advanced injection timing). WHITE smoke is usually water (often caused by retarded injection timing). If the smoking is continuous or appears under a particular condition, the smoke probably indicates a problem and should be investigated. 

If STEXE-R is not available, there is no easy way to test compression. In this case, go on to the next step but remember that compression may be a problem. 

#### Compression Unbalance Stuice-R Test 14 I

This paragraph is a top level test for all of the lubrication systems in the vehicle. Just follow the path and answer the questions. Additional information and notes are given on the facing page when necessary. The H&lMWV includes a venting system that is also checked in this paragraph. The purpose of the vent system is to allow vapor to escape to the atmosphere under normal operation, and to prevent venting during deep-water fording operations. If the vents were left open, water would enter the engine and other systems and cause damage. The location of the vent lines is shown below. The location of the other parts in the lubrication system are shown in other lower level paragraph as required.

# 2-27. Electrical Tests I

Most of the electrical circuits in the vehicle are included in one of the major systems covered by this manual. This is a top level paragraph to help you pick the right one. A number of schematics are also included to help you find the problem. If you go through the flow chart and can't solve the problem, use the schematics to find wires which may be causing trouble. 

The electrical system consists of the batteries, which produce electrical power by a chemical reaction between the lead plates and the electrolyte solution (a mixture of acid and water). This power is carried by wires and cables to those parts of the vehicle which require electrical power. The batteries get recharged by the alternator, which generates electrical power by using some of the engine's mechanical power, produced when the engine is running. If you are not too confident about electrical concepts and terminology, you should read para. 2-22, page 2-43. All electrical systems require a connection to ground (called grounding), which is the completion of the circuit to the battery negative. Pages 2-90, 2-91, and 2-92 are diagrams of the grounding. If your vehicle exhibits strange symptoms that seem to defy all efforts to fix them, the vehicle may have a grounding problem. Grounding problems cause strange symptoms usually because more than one circuit is using the same ground, or because a circuit has more than one ground. For example, looking at the body ground diagram, if wire 58D (a ground for the instruments) is disconnected from the left-side cylinder head, the instruments may still function due to the separate ground, but they would probably be erratic and inaccurate. Usually the problem will be a loose or corroded connection between the circuit, through body ground to battery negative terminal. Be sure to check continuity to battery negative cable rather than simply to the vehicle body or engine block. After the grounding diagrams are functional flow schematics of the major systems in the vehicle. The shaded areas are the wires and components of the vehicle master power distribution. These are designed to help you find the system giving you problems.

The lights are the only circuit on the vehicle which should work or be drawing any power when the switch is in the STOP position. Check the instruments, try turning on the heater fan, listen for any relay clicking or other sign (includes engine running) that power is on when it shouldn't be. 

It's best if you use the STEKE-R in TK mode to verify that there is no current draw from the batteries. You can't use the DCA mode for this because it will measure this current during the calibration part of the test and read that this is just an offset in the sensor.

## 2-28. Fuel System Tests

These fuel system tests can be run any time you think there may be a problem with the fuel system or if you were sent here from another test. 

If you are running this test because the engine runs rough, remember that air intake and exhaust as well as internal mechanical problems can also cause this condition. 

At the bottom of this page is a simplified block diagram which shows how the different fuel system components relate to each other. Refer to fold-out page FP-1 and leave open for reference while you are testing. 

![220_image_0.png](220_image_0.png)

#### Reference Information

MAKE SURE AU ELECTRICAL CONNECTtONS ARE CLEAN AND TIGKT. CHECK FUEL SOLENOID, COLD ADVANCE SOLENOID. BAll-ERIES. ROTARY 
SWITCH, ETC. 

1. While cranking or running the engine, open the drain fitting and drain some fuel into a clear container. 

2. The fuel should come out of the open 
-drainvalve in a steady stream. If it doesn't, then answer NO to this question. 

l NOTE: Nothing will come out unless the engine is running or cranking. 

3. Close the drainvalve and turn the rotary switch to STOP. 

4. Check the fuel that came out to be sure that it isn't contaminated with water or dirt. 

5. If the fuel didn't come out in a steady stream or if it is contaminated, answer NO to this question. 

If you have trouble starting the engine, you should have entered here by way of the startability tests. If you didn't begin there, go back to page 2-45 and run the startability top level test. At this point, you don't care how well it starts or runs but just that it will run. The answer to this question is NO if the engine seems to start but stops almost immediately. 

Engine temperature may be determined from vehicle temp. gauge (rotary switch must be in RUN position) or by touching the engine. If it is too hot to touch comfortably, it is above 120° F (49O C). 

Hard starting can be caused by other things such as fuel in the lines leaking back into the tank while the engine is shut down. This will occur if there is an air leak in the lines.

## Reference Information

FUEL SYSTEM 
Watch the fuel pump pressure while slowly accelerating the engine from idle to maximum speed. The pressure should always be greater than zero. If you can drive the vehicle while measuring the pressure, check to be sure it is still above zero even during maximum acceleration (maximum engine power). You can use STUICE-R test 24 with control function 02 (minimum). 

Rapidly accelerating the engine with the transmission in neutral doesn't work for this engine because the fuel supply can't increase as fast as the engine can accelerate so you won't get good test results. 

Proper engine performance depends upon the availability of the correct fuel volume to the injection pump. 

Pay attention to when the engine runs rough. If it runs rough only while warming up after a cold start, it may be a glow plug problem and you should run the Glow Plug Circuit tests. Rough running may also be caused by air leaks in the fuel supply lines. Air in the fuel should purge itself while idling. If rough running occurs after **a period of** 
high speed or high power running but seems to go away after idling, then look for air leaks in the fuel supply lines and **fittings. If rough running occurs** while driving but idles ok, check the fuel return check valve for any malfunctions (para. 3-36). 

Try to adjust the engine idle speed by turning the idle speed screw (para. 3-45). Continue testing if you can adjust the speed property. If you cannot, notify DS maintenance (chapter 14). 

Engine must be at normal operating temperature when making speed checks. Air filter must be in place and all accessories (lights, heater fan, etc.) 
must be turned off. 

Thts engme has a min-max governor which controls engine speed at both idle and full thronle. 

# I **Fuel Pump Volume Test**

1. Disconnect fuel line at injection pump inlet and route fuel line into a suitable 1 quart 
(1 liter) container. 

2. Crank the engine for 30 seconds. 3. If the pump and lines are ok, you should gE 
about 1 pint (l/2 quart) (.5 L) in 30 second5 

#### Fuel Pump Pressure Ste/Lce-R Test 24

(SLUICE already connected to DCA and turned on) 1. Select Fuel Supply Pressure test, Test 24. 

2. Perform CAL. 3. Crank (or start) the engine.

Return lines should be inspected for kinks or crushed lines or anything that might restict fuel flow.

Inspect fuel return check valve for any restrictions. Replace valve (para. 3-36). Replace fuel lines (para. 3-26).

If you came here from the startability tests, return to STEP 5, page 2-48. If you haven't run the startability tests yet, go to STEP 1, page 2-46.

![235_image_0.png](235_image_0.png)

During high temperature and humidity, early model vehicles can experience difficulty starting while using JP-8 fuel. High temperatures can cause restrictive clearances in some older fuel injection head and rotor assemblies. The engine must be allowed to cool to allow adequate clearance of the pumping plungers to ensure adequate fuel delivery for starting. If this condition persists, run the startability tests. If vehicle passes all startability tests and troubleshooting procedures and still experiences difficulty in hot starting, identify the fuel injection pump and serial numbers. All fuel injection pumps with P/N DB2831-5209, NSN 2910-01-467-9029 incorporated the improved head and rotor assembly, P/N 31506. If your serial number is less than shown in the Serial Number Break Column of the table below, the manufacturer recommends the fuel injection pump to be replaced, tagged as a "no hot restart" condition, and forward for rebuild. Notify direct support maintenance.

The engine temperature must be below 90° F (32°C) to get voltage here. If the engine is warm, either wait for it to cool, or go to step C3 at the bottom of the page and remember that the cold advance may be the problem if everything else checks out OK. The glow plugs or the intake/exhaust system may be faulty, so you should test them first. 

The cold advance circuit advances the fuel injectton pump timing approximately 3 to 5 degrees during cold start-up. If engine temperature is less than 90°F (32°C). then advance circuit operation may be 1 checked as follows: 
4. 

Start the engine. Disconnect wire 6698 from the advance solenoid. If the circuit is working correctly, then engine rpm should decrease. Look at the advance mechanism on the right side of the fuel injection pump while you connect and disconnect 5698 with the engine running. The advance mechanism should move about l/4 in. If the advance mechanism is stuck, apply some oil at the points shown and try again.

Diesel fuel is sensitive to temperature. All diesel 

![240_image_1.png](240_image_1.png) fuel has a certain amount of paraffin-like components which have high energy value and help improve fuel economy. When temperatures are less than 20°F (-7°C) these components begin turning into wax flakes that can build up on the fuel tank strainer or in the fuel filter. If wax build-up is found, replace the fuel in the tank with a winter grade of fuel if available. You will have to remove the fuel tank if you need to inspect the tank strainer (para. 3-25).

-4 Fuel lines should be inspected for kinks, cracks, or anything that would restrict fuel flow or allow air to enter the lines. Be sure to check the lines all the way back to the tank and remember that there is a strainer 
.inside the tank which can become plugged. You will have to remove the tank if it becomes necessary to check this. Replace fuel lines (para. 3-26). 

Poor starting and excessive smoke after start-up can be the result of a restticted fuel supply. This restriction most likely will be from a plugged fuel filter but can also be caused by a pinched or kinked fuel line. After the engine warms up. it generally will run satisfactorily. If the restriction gets progressively worse, top speed and performance will also be affected. FUNGUS In warm or humid weather, fungi and/or bacteria in the fuel can cause fuel system damage by plugging the fuel lines, filter, or injection noules. For removal, replacement, and torques, refer to para. 3-34 or notify DS maintenance (chapter 16). 

Excessive roughness on any of these pans is an indication of wear. The pushrod should slide smoothly in the engine block. If you notice any roughness on the end of the pushrod, be sure to check the lobe on the camshaft. 

H the pump or rod is worn, replace (para. 3-24). If the lobe on the camshaft is worn, notify DS maintenance (chapter 16).

Check the filter vent screw for tightness. 

![246_image_1.png](246_image_1.png) Check the supply lines for kinks, cracks. leaks, or loose connections that could restrict fuel flow or allow air to enter the system. Remember that under certain operating conditions parts of the fuel system can be under vacuum so that loose connections that may not leak fuel can let air in. To test for air leaks in the supply lines, disconnect the return line from the injection pump and connect a line that is long enough to reach the ground. Place the end of the line into a bucket containing diesel fuel, making sure that the end of the line is below the level of fuel in the bucket. Run the engine and watch for air bubbles in the bucket. You can also replace the short return line from the injector pump with a clear piece of tubing to check for bubbles. 

Inspect the return lines for kinks or any other blockage that may restrict fuel flow.

Be sure to keep the line clear of moving engine parts (fan, pulleys, etc.) and DO NOT place the line on the exhaust manffold. 

Fuel lines should be inspected for kinks, cracks, or anything that would restrict fuel flow or allow air into the lines. Se sure to check the lines all the way back to the tank and remember that there is a strainer inside the tank which can also become plugged. To test for air leaks in the suppty lines. disconnect the return line from the injection pump and connect a line that is long enough to reach the ground. 

Place the end of the line into a bucket containing diesel fuel, making sure that the end of the line is below the level of fuel in the bucket. Run the engine and watch for air bubbles in the bucket. Replace fuel line (para. 3-26). 

An important function of all hoses, lines, and fittings is to carry fuel without admitting air to the system. When the fuel tank cap is in place and the fuel pump and injection pump are drawing fuel through the lines. a low vacuum of 6-l PSI is created. This occurs because the fuel which the engine uses must be replaced by air. During this vacuum condition, the slightest leak, which may not leak fuel out, could draw air into the system and, depending on the volume of air, cause a wide variety of engine malfunctions. 

#### Cold Weather Operation

Diesel fuel is sensitive to temperature. All diesel fuel has a certain amount of wax-like components which have high energy value and help improve fuel economy. When temperatures are less than 20°F (-7°C). these components begin turning into flakes that can build up on the fuel tank strainer or in the fuel filter. 

FUNGUS In warm or humid weather, fungi and/or bacteria can cause fuel system damage by plugging the fuel lines, filter, or injection nozzles. ODOR Old fuel smells like varnish. 

Check the accelerator pedal for full movement with no sticking or binding. If you have sticking or binding, lubricate accelerator pedal bushing and bearing with seasonal grade OE oil (TM 9-2320-367-10). If you do not have full pedal travel, disconnect the accelerator linkage from the fuel injection pump and recheck the travel. If you now have full travel, the problem is in the fuel injection pump and cannot be handled at this level of maintenance. 

Operation of the injection pump and injectors cannot be verified at this level of maintenance.

Be careful **when performing** 
this test. Exhaust gas can be extremely hot and severe burns can result. 

Put a piece of paper in the exhaust stream for a few moments with the engine at idle. **Then look** at the paper to see if there is any condensed fuel on it. **Then smell** the paper to see if it smells like raw fuel. If it smells like fuel, the engine could be very cold or else it has a DS 
level fuel system fault or compression fault. 

-._ -I White smoke for a short time after start-up, especially on a cold day, is a normal condition. It is caused by incomplete combustion of the fuel because of low cylinder temperature. It should clear up in a few minutes. If not, you may have a bad head gasket, cracked block, or a restricted check valve. Check for 1 restricted check valve (para. 3-36).

If the cold advance solenoid is getting power, the only possibilities that would keep the engine from starting are that fuel is not reaching the cylinders due to a fault in the high-pressure side of the fuel system or nearly all the cylinders have very low compression.

# Reference Information Fuel System

If you are getting white smoke due to coolant entering the cylinders. 

you should notice a loss of coolant in the radiator or bubbles in the radiator tank while the engine is running. You may need to fill the radiator to proper level and recheck a day later to determine if there is a coolant loss. If you don't detect coolant loss, you may have missed a fuel problem. Rerun the fuel system tests paying attention for a raw exhaust smell. 

If you still find nothing, you may have a small or inconsistant leak. Notify OS maintenance (chapter 14).

Keep hands away from engine fan. Moving fan blades can cause serious injury. Use extreme caution when engine is running. 

If the engine doesn't shut off with the solenoid disconnected, fuel is still reaching the cylindersprobably because the fuel solenoid is stuck open. When you squeeze the return line tight enough to prevent fuel flowing through it, you create a pressure imbalance inside the injection pump that will cause the engine to stall.

These air intake/exhaust system tests can be run any time you think there may be a problem with the air intake or exhaust systems, or if you were sent here from another test. 

At the bottom of this page is a simplified block diagram of the intake air/exhaust system. A detailed functional flow is not applicable to this system. 

The air intake/exhaust system is a very simple system that can cause very annoying problems. Whether the vehicle is hard to start or runs rough or never develops full power, it's worth the few minutes that it takes to check the components of this system. You can run through the diagnostic logic for this system almost any time you open the hood or check the underside of your vehicle.

#### Reference Information

## Compression / Mechanical

#### Engine Rpm Stoice-R Test **10 I**

1. Start Test 10, Engine RPM. 

2. Crank or start the engine. Displayed reading is RPM. Cranking rpm should be approximately 100-200. Idle rpm should

be 625 - 675. 

![272_image_0.png](272_image_0.png)

#### Oil Pressure Stehce-R Test 50

1. Install STEIfCE-A 0 to1000 PSI (O-6.895 kPa) transducer (blue stripe) in place of oil pressure sending unit. 2. Connect to STEIICE-R TK connector J2 or J3. 3. CAL with engine off. 4. Start engine. Run test 50. With the engine warm, oil pressure should be 10 psi (69 kPa) minimum at idle and 40-45 psi (275-310 kPa) at 2.000 rpm. Pressure may go as high as 80 psi 
(552 kPa) when the engine is cold. 

A healthy engine should crank at least 100 mm when it's cold and at least 180-206 rpm when it's warm. 

If the engine doesn't crank at normal speed, it could be due to a starter or battery circuit fault or it may be due to an internal engine problem. 

Oil pressure may go as high as 60 psi (552 kPa) if the engine is cold and should be 10 psi minimum at idle speed. You should check the oil pressure with the STEIICE-R (test 50) using 1,000 psi (6,895 kPa) transducer (blue stripe). Check pressure at idle and at 2,000 rpm. If pressure is low, check oil level and condition. Add or change oil as required.

# 2-31. Engine Cooling Tests (Serial Numbers 299999 And Below)

I
These engine cooling tests may be run any time you think you have an engine cooling problem or if you were sent here by another test chain. Just follow the path, answering the questions.  Additional information and notes are given on the facing page when necessary.

Please note that this paragraph is NOT for diagnoses of problems with the temperature sending unit or the gauge.

Once you are sure that the cooling system is OK, run the instruments test in paragraph 2-38 to find out if the gauge is OK.

Fold-out page FP-6.1 contains a functional diagram of the engine cooling system. This page may be left open for reference while testing.

The engine cooling system is a pressure-type cooling system with thermostatic control of coolant circulation.  The cooling system dissipates heat generated from combustion and maintains the enqine operating temperature at its most efficient level. When the engine is cold and the thermostat is closed, coolant is recirculated through the water pump and engine.  As the engine coolant reaches 215°F (102°C), the thermostat opens, allowing coolant to flow through the radiator before returning to the water pump and engine.  Any air or vapor in the cooling system will be forced to the surge tank under the liguid level and leave through a vent tube.  As the system cools, the extra coolant in the tank will be drawn back to the radiator.  Normally a 50-50 mixture of water and ethylene glycol-based antifreeze will be used.  The fan is activated when coolant temperature reaches approximately 220° F
(104°C).  A separate oil cooler is mounted in front of the radiator.  This cooler is divided into two parts. The top half is for transmission oil. The bottom half is for engine oil. When the cooling svstem pressure reaches approximately 15 psi (103 kPa), a valve in the surge tank cap opens and lets excess pressure escape to the atmosphere.

# Engine Cooling Fan Description Of Operation

An external line from the power steening gear brings hydraulic fluid to the clutch fan solenoid through control valve (normally open) and then to the fan drive, keeping it disengaged. The action of the valve is controlled by the time-delay module and the fan temperature switch.

During normal operation, the fan timer switch is closed. This keeps the control valve in the open position and the drive disengaged.

As the engine reaches a temperature of about 215°F (102°C), the temperature switch opens and the control valve closes. This engages the fan. If the fan is engaged and the accelerator is floored, the throttle position sensor disengages the fan drive for a period of 20 seconds.

The easiest way to determine if the fan is engaged is to stand outside the driver's door and gently work the accelerator. If the fan is engaged, you will feel a breeze from the engine area. If the fan is not engaged, you won't feel the breeze.

Always use caution when approaching a hot engine.  Failure to do so may result in serious burns.

Look for excessive white exhaust smoke, steam leaks in the engine compartment, and oil in the coolant.  Other signs include excess condensation in the exhaust system, or white joints in the exhaust system. You can also feel the coolant hoses to see if they have high pressure caused by leaking combustion gasses. Also, if the glow plugs turn off very quickly after starting the engine, or if the engine overheats, or has excessive coolant consumption, you may have a head gasket problem.

# 2-31.1. Engine Cooling Tests (Serial Numbers 300000 And Above)

These engine cooling tests may be run any time vou think you have an engine cooling problem or if you were sent here by another test chain. Just follow the path, answering the questions. Additional information and notes are given on the facing page when necessary. Please note that this paragraph is NOT for diagnoses of problems with the temperature sending unit or the gauge.

Once you are sure that the cooling system is OK, run the instruments test in paragraph 2-38 to find out if the gauge is OK.

Fold-out page FP-7 contains a functional diagram of the engine cooling system. This page may be left open for reference while testing.

The engine cooling system is a pressure-type cooling system with thermostatic control of coolant circulation. The cooling system dissipates heat generated from combustion and maintains the engine operating temperature at its most efficient level. When the engine is cold and the thermostat is closed, coolant is recirculated through the water pump and engine. As the engine coolant reaches 190°F
(87.7°C), the thermostat opens, allowing coolant to flow through the radiator before returning to the water pump and engine. Any air or vapor in the cooling system will be forced to the surge tank under the liquid level and leave through a vent tube. As the system cools, the extra coolant in the tank will be drawn back to the radiator. Normally a 50-50 mixture of water and ethylene glycol-based antifreeze will be used. The fan is activated when coolant temperature reaches approximately 220° F (104°C). A separate oil cooler is mounted in front of the radiator. This cooler is divided into two parts. The top half is for transmission oil. The bottom half is for engine oil. When the cooling system pressure reaches approximately 15 psi (103 kPa), a valve in the surge tank cap opens and lets excess pressure escape to the atmosphere.

#### Engine Cooling Fan Description Of Operation

When the thermostat detects the coolant is hot, the thermostat opens, and allows the coolant to be pumped to the radiator where it is routed through a series of fins and tubes. A fan draws in the outside air to help dissipate the heat before the coolant is recirculated back through the engine. The fan is driven from the engine crankshaft via the geared fan drive and a viscous drive. The geared fan drive unit is supported by the front rear crossmember, connects to the harmonic balancer of the engine and places the viscous drive and fan assembly on the same plane as, and close to, the radiator for maximum cooling efficiency. A helical gearset is utilized within the geared fan drive to change the drive angle from the crankshaft to the fan. Gear lube with friction modifier lubricates the internal components of the geared fan drive using an integral reservoir and pump. Two constant velocity joints and a torsional driveshaft connect the geared fan drive to the engine crankshaft at the harmonic balancer.

Always use caution when approaching a hot engine. Failure to do so may result in serious burns.

Look for excessive white exhaust smoke, steam leaks in the engine compartment, and oil in the coolant.  Other signs include excess condensation in the exhaust system, or white joints in the exhaust system.  You can also feel the coolant hoses to see if they have high pressure caused by leaking combustion gasses. Also, if the glow plugs turn off very quickly after starting the engine, or if the engine overheats, or has excessive coolant consumption, you may have a head gasket problem.

BAD CONNECTIONS ARE THE
MOST COMMON PROBLEM !

Sometimes, just disconnecting, cleaning, and reconnecting will solve a problem. BE THOROUGH!

The time you save may be your own.

Refer to the functional flow schematic and check the following:
1. BATTERY - make sure all connections are clean and tight, including the shunt and power stud.

2. STARTER - check the high current wire (heavy gauge wire 6A) at the starter. Don't just check for voltage; a loose connection will have voltage but can't carry much current.

3. PROTECTIVE CONTROL BOX

DO NOT USE THE DCA. Leave the negative battery cable off for the measurement. If there is an open circuit, the STE/ICE-R will measure close to 500 ohms. If you don't have continuity or voltage, and the wires and connections are all OK, then the hamess must have a broken wire. In this case, you have to replace the wiring hamess. Replace hamess and notify DS maintenance
(chapter 18).

Replace PCB (para. 4-4).

## Resistance And Continuity 0-4,500 Ohms Steace-R Test 91

1. Connect RED clip and BLACK clip to the terminations indicated in the question. RED to the first, BLACK to the second.

2. Start Test 91, 0-4,500 Ohms.

3. Displayed reading is in ohms. Less than 5 ohms is continuity. If the resistance is over 4,500 ohms, STE/ICE-R displays .9.9.9.9.9.9.9.

## 2-36. Starter Circuit Tests

The starter circuit consists of the batteries, starter solenoid, starter motor, rotary switch, parts of the Protective Control Box (PCB) and related electrical wiring. The relationship of these parts is shown in the block diagram below, and a simplified functional flow schematic is provided on the foldout FP-15. 

The starter solenoid and starter motor are enclosed in housings to protect them from dirt, icing conditions, and other road hazards. When the rotary switch is turned to START, the PCB checks if the engine is running. If the engine is not running, the PCB sends a signal to the starter solenoid which energizes the solenoid windings and causes the solenoid contacts to close, sending battery power to the starter motor. The battery power causes the starter motor pinion gear to engage the engine flywheel ring gear and the engine cranks. When the engine starts, the rotary switch should be released, allowing it to return to the RUN position. This tells the PCB to release the starter solenoid which, in turn, disengages the starter motor from the engine.

## 2-37. Glow Plugs Circuit Tests

These tests of the glow plugs circuit can be run any time you think there may be a problem with the glow plugs, or if you were sent here from another test. 

If you were sent from another test, be sure to mark where you came from so you will be able to return. 

If you are running this test because the engine is hard to start when cold, remember that there'is also a cold-start advance circuit (part of the fuel system) which is not checked here. 

For any starting problem, we recommend running the STARTABILITY test chain just to be sure you don't miss anything. 

At the bottom of this page is a simplified block diagram which shows how the different parts of the glow plug circuit depend on each other and on other engine circuits. 

Refer to fold-out page FP-17 and leave it open for reference while performing these tests. The fold-out diagram is arranged to allow you to follow the diagnostic logic and understand what you are testing, when, and why.

## Reference Information Glow Plugs Circuit

If the engine cranks ok (or starts), then the batteries are good enough for testing the glow plugs. If the engine starts, shut it off. 

You can use STEXE Test 10 to measure cranking speed. 

The engine should crank at least 100 rpm in cold weather and at least 180 rpm in warm weather.

Disconnect negative battery cable before disconnecting and reconnecting PCB harness. 

There is battery voltage at the PCB at all times. Failure to disconnect battery cable will result in damage to equipment or injury to Personnel. 

#### Bad Connections Are Thf Most Common Problem !

Sometimes just disconnecting, cleaning, and reconnecting will solve a problem. BE THOROUGH! The time you save may be your own. Refer to the functional flow schematic and check the following: 
1. BAlTERY - make sure all connections are clean and tight. including the shunt and power stud.

#### Normal Glow Plug Operation

The glow plugs first come ON when the engine temperature is below 120 "F (49°C) and the rotary switch is turned lo RUN. They stay ON for up to 9 seconds and then go OFF. 

They will stay OFF for about 7-15 sewnds then come ON 
again for about 1 second. 

#### Note Note

The WAIT-TO-START lamp is NOT diagnosed in this section. If the lamp does not work properly, the glow plug circuit may be affecting Its operation. Run these tests to check out the glow plug circuit. If the lamp still does not work properly, go to the INSTRUMENT section

#### Baltery Current Multimeter

1. Set the voltmeter to a DC volts scale of about 1 volt. 

2. Connect the BLACK lead to the battery side of the current shunt and the RED lead to the other end of the current shunt. 

3. Current shunt voltage is proportional lo battery current, 100 millivolts = 1,000 amps. To get current, multiply millivolts x 10.

#### Baltery Current Steiice-R Test 80 I

To check for glow plug current **draw, start** STE/lCE-R Test 80, Battery Current. Turn off all accessories (lights, heater, wipers, etc.). STE/ICE-R **should immediately measure at least** 
74 amps. Take note, however, that if all your glow plugs are working, the current **draw** 
should be close to or more than 100 amps, especially if it's cold. If it's near freezing and the glow plugs only draw 75-60 amps, you probably have a few bad glow plugs.

The glow plugs first come ON when the engine temperature is below 120 OF (49 "C) and the rotary switch is turned to RUN. They stay ON for up to 9 seconds and then go OFF. They will stay OFF for about 7-l 5 seconds then come ON again for about 1 second, then go OFF again. If you don't start the engine, the glow plugs should keep cycling like this, due to the glow plug cycle timer in the glow plugs controller. If you start the engine, they will cycle until the engine is warm, due to the afterglow cycle timer in the glow plug controller. When the engine gets up to 120°F (49°C) the glow plugs should stop cyckng completely. 

If the glow plugs are cycling properly, you should hear a click from the PCB when the glow plugs turn on and when they turn off. This is the glow plug cycle timer, a thermal circuit breaker. A good way to check for cycling is STE/ICE-R test 80, Battery Current. When the glow plugs turn on, STE/lCE-R will measure 74-125 amps. When the glow plugs turn off, the STEIICE-R will measure 3-8 amps. 

#### Fnginf Running. Rotary Switch In Run

If the glow plugs are cycling property, you can hear a click from the PCB when the glow plugs turn on and when they turn off (you may have to duck your head under the dash). This is the afterglow cycle timer, a thermal circuit breaker. A good way to check for cycling is STEIICE-R test 80, Battery Current. When the glow plugs turn on, STEIlCE-R 
will measure 74-125 amps. When the glow plugs turn off, STE/ICE-R will measure 3-8 amps. As the engine gets warmer, the glow plugs turn on less frequently and for less time. 

If you don't have a STEACE-R or a multimeter for measuring current, you can watch the vehicle volts gauge for indication of glow plug operation. The glow plugs draw so much current that the volts gauge should jump about half-an-inch to the left when the glow plugs come on. Before starting the engine, you should hear the glow plug power relay click open and closed as the glow plugs cycle. (You can hear the relay after the engine has started by leaning your head under the dash near the PCB.) This method won't tell you if all the glow plugs are working property, but it at least shows that the glow plugs are trying to work and that the glow plug power relay is working.

#### Checking Glow Plugs 8 Their Wirfs

1. Disconnect ALL the glow plugs. 

2. Disconnect the neoative battery cable. Disconnect the PCB 
connector harnessfrom the PdB. Reconnect the negative battery cable. Measure me resistance between pin D in the engine connector harness of the PCB and ground. There should NOT be continuity (resistance reading off the scale). If there is continuity, repair or replace me harness. Repeat the following for each glow plug: 
3. 

a. Reconnect the wiring harness to the glow plug while you repeat the resistance measurement described in step 2. When you reconnect the wire to the glow plug, the resistance should drop to between 1 and 2 ohms (glow plugs are typically 1.6 ohms). 

b. If step A passed: 
disconnect the glowptug again, making sure the resistance goes off scale again. Repeat step A for me next glow plug. 

C. If step A failed: 
then either the glow plug or its wire is no good. Take the wire off the glow plug again and measure the resistance from the glow plug to the engine block. If the resistance is 1 - 2 ohms, then the cable is no good. Otherwise replace the glow plug and check the cable for continuity, just to be sure. 

4. Reconnect the PCB and all wires. 

Dead glow plugs draw virtually no current, but other parts of the vehicle are drawing some current-up to 8 amps. If any glow plugs are drawing any current, then the PCB is probably OK.

# 1 2-39. Lights Tests I

The lights tests have almost no flow chart to guide you through a problem.This is because there aren't very many problems that can occur. The most common problems are burned-out bulbs and loose or corroded connections. Aside from bulbs and wiring, the only components are the Protective Control Box and the lights switch. If either of these is found to be faulty, you just replace the bad unit. On the following pages you will find diagrams of the major portions of the lights circuit. These are designed to help you isolate a problem without wasting too much time.

# 2-40. Transmission System Tests

NOTE
When checking fault codes, note that low battery voltage can cause false fault codes to be set in TCM.

The transmission system is equipped with a computer called the Transmission Control Module (TCM) (located left rear seat compartment) which interprets, analyzes and records electronic signals from sensors and switches located on the engine, brake pedal, and transmission. The recorded codes stored in the TCM are known as TROUBLE CODES which are retrieved using the diagnostic switch cable on the J2 connector of the TCM. The TCM
can protect the transmission from damage by locking it in second gear, with maximum fluid pressure, until the problem has been corrected. The following procedures will detail diagnostic testing, troubleshooting, and corrective action for any existing faults. These transmission system tests may be run any time you think there is a transmission problem or if you were sent here by another test chain. This paragraph has a different kind of flow chart to quide you through testing because of the many problems that can occur. The most common problems are loose or corroded wiring connections. To troubleshoot the transmission. vou will need a diagnostic switch cable (appendix B, item 81), digital multimeter (appendix B, item 155) and a throttle position (TP) sensor test cable (appendix B, item 80).

Do not disconnect battery without recording trouble codes. Failure to do so will result in loss of diagnostic test codes.

The Diagnostic Test Codes (DTC) are transmitted from the TCM to transmission lamp located next to the shift lever. When diagnostic switch cable is connected to the J2 connector. the system is placed in the diagnostic mode, which causes the transmission lamp to flash. The transmission lamp will flash once, pause, flash twice (meaning code 12), pause, flash once, pause, flash twice (code 12 again), and do this one more time for a total of three times, which means the system is operational.

Diagnostic test code 63 will be set at all times.

For example, if the TCM is sending the trouble code 74, the lamp will flash 12 three times. flash 63 three times, which is set all the time and is to be disregarded, flash code 7 and 4, 7 and 4. 7 and 4 for code 74, and then 12, 12, 12, which ends the diagnostic check. These codes will repeat again if not taken out of diagnostic mode.

The TCM J1 connector will be used to diagnose and troubleshoot wiring, sensor connectors, pins, solenoids, and brake switch to ensure all external problems are checked and corrected prior to TCM and transmission faults.

On the following pages you will find diagrams and charts of the major portions of the transmission circuits. These are designed to help you isolate a problem and correct it.

Procedure for checkina transmission fluid 1. Start engine. 2. Hold down brake pedal and move transmission shift lever through all ranges including reverse. Leave the lever in each range for 2 seconds. 

3. Engage parking brake and place shit lever in neutral. Check fluid level on dipstick. 4. Proper level is between FULL and ADD marks on dipstick 

Check fluid for a burnt smell, grit, discoloration, air bubbles, or a milky appearance. 

l Burnt smell, discoloration, or grit indicates worn or damaged internal components. 

Notify DS maintenance (chapter 14). 

l Bubbles indicate an overfilled system or air leaks in the system. Drain the fluid and refill to proper level (para. 5-2). 

l Milky appearance is due to water in the system. Change the fluid and filter (para. 5-2). l Check fill tube for indications of fluid being blown out. If fluid is being blown out, check vent line for obstructions, and refill transmission to proper level (para. 5-2).

## Jload Test Procedure U

1. Position shift lever in 0 (overdrive) and accelerate vehicle from 0 mph. A l-2.2-3. and 3-4 shift should occur at all throttle openings. Allow vehicle to **coast** down to about 0 mph; 4-3.3-2, and 2-1 shifts should occur. 

2. Position transmission shii lever in D (drive) and accelerate vehicle from 0 mph. A l-2 and 2-3 shift should occur at all throttle openings. Allow vehicle to coast down to about 0 mph; 3-2 and 2-l shifts should occur. 

3. Position transmission shi lever in 2 (low two) and accelerate vehicle from 0 mph. A l-2 shift should occur at all throttle openings. No 2-3 shitt can be obtained in this range. A l-2 shift in 2 is somewhat firmer than in D. This is normal. 

4. Position shift lever in 1 and accelerate the vehicle from 0 mph. No upshifts should occur in this range. 

5. Position shift lever in 8, and with the vehicle speed at approximately 45 mph, close throttle and move lever to 3. 

Transmission should downshift to 3rd gear. An increase in engine rpm and engine braking effect should be noticed. 

6. Position shift lever in @, and with the vehicle speed at approximately 35 mph, close throttle and move lever to 2. 

Transmission should downshift to 2nd gear. An increase in engine rpm and engine braking effect shordd be noticed. 

7. Position shift lever 2 and, with the vehicle speed at approximately 25 mph, close the throttle and move lever to 1. 

Transmission should downshift to 1st gear. An increase in engine rpm and engine braking effect should be noticed. 

6. Position shift lever in R and check for reverse operation. 9. Hard shifting may be indicative of an under-filled or clogged system. 

The TP sensor is used to shift the transmission to a lower gear under heavy acceleration.

#### Circuit Description:

The Pressure Control Solenoid (PCS) is a TCM-
controlled device used to regulate transmission line pressure. The TCM compares TP voltage, engine rpm, and other inputs to determine the appropriate line pressure of a given load. The TCM will regulate the pressure by applying a varying amperage to the PCS. 

The applied amperage can vary from 0.1 to 1.1 amp. The TCM then monitors the amperage at the return line. 

#### Dtc 73 Will Set When:

l *The* return amperage varies greater than 0.16 amp from the commanded amperage. 

l All conditions are met for 1 second.

## Dtc 74 Transmission Input Speed Sensor (Tiss) Circuit

As the transmission fluid temperature warms to normal transmission operating temperature 212°F 
(lOO"C), the sensor resistance becomes less and the voltage decreases to approximately 1.5 to 2.0 volts. 

#### Dtc 79 Will Set When:

l Transmission fluid temperature is greater than 295°F (146°C). 

l All conditions are met for 30 minutes.

l The TCM commands the solenoid OFF and voltage remains low. 

l All conditions are met for 2 seconds.

## Dtc 83 Tcc Solenoid (Pwm) Circuit Fault

#### Circuit Description:

The control module supplies a ground through an internal Quad-Driver Module (QDM), allowing current to flow through the solenoid coil according to the duty cycle (percentage of ON and OFF time). This current flow through the solenoid coil creates a magnetic field that magnetizes the solenoid core. 

The magnetized core attracts the checkball to seat against spring pressure. This blocks the exhaust for the TCC signal fluid and allows 2-3 drive fluid to feed the TCC signal circuit. The TCC signal fluid pressure acts on the TCC regulator valve to regulate line pressure and to apply fluid pressure to the TCC shift valve. When the TCC shift valve is in the apply position, regulated applied fluid pressure is directed through the TCC valve to apply the torque converter clutch. 

#### Dtc 83 Will Set When:

The TCM commands the solenoid ON and voltage remains high. 

The TCM commands the solenoid OFF and voltage remains low. All conditions are met for 2 seconds.

WARNING

![576_image_0.png](576_image_0.png)

Make sure that the area where you conduct these tests is free of natural and man-made obstructions. Failure to do so may result in serious injury.

# · Prior To Performing These Tests:

Visually inspect steering components:
1. Check all four tires and rims for wear, inflation, damage, or warping.

a. Adjust tire pressure (TM 9-2320-387-10). b. Replace any unserviceable rims (para. 8-4).

2. Check steering linkage for damage.

a. Replace any damaged steering linkage components (para. 8-11). b. Lubricate steering linkage (TM 9-2320-387-10).

3. Check power steering fluid for contamination and level
(TM 9-2320-387-10).

a. Drain and replace any fluid that appears black and smells burnt. b. Bleed air from system where fluid appears milky white (para. 8-27).

4. Check serpertine drivebelt for fraying, cracks, or damage.

Replace damaged serpentine drivebelt (para. 3-81).

While travelling at a moderate speed (20 mph (32 kph)), apply the brakes while applying minimal pressure to the steering wheel. If pull to one side or the other occurs, make a note of the speed and on what side of the vehicle it occurs. Repeat this  procedure for different speeds and braking forces. If the vehicle seems to steer straight while braking, there probably isn't a problem with the brakes (at least not one that affects the steering). If the braking action feels strange in any way, the brake diagnostics should be run to assure vehicle safety. This test will usually reveal problems with frozen brake calipers.

If the wheels are out of alignment or if the tires are worn unevenly, vehicle may wander.

Symptoms of bad steering characteristics include hard steering, excesssive play in steering, a momentary increase in steering effort when tuming whee!

quickly, and jerking of the steering wheel when turning.

Do not overfill hydraulic fluid.

See TM 9-2320-387-10 for fluid replacement procedure. For bleeding procedure, refer to para. 8-27.

Low fluid level could indicate a problem elsewhere in the system; either leaking hydraulic lines or a leaking or damaged power steering pump. If adding fluid seems to cure the problem, you should probably run the rest of the tests to make sure there aren't any other problems.

![582_image_2.png](582_image_2.png)

Serpentine belt failure (abnormal wear or belt dislodgement) can be caused by misalignment of pulleys, improper installation, or foreign objects introduced into belt path. Inspect water pump pulley for proper installation and ease of rotation. Any wobble or misalignment will cause belt failure. Refer to para. 3-81 for pulley alignment procedures.

A loose pump, pulley, or bracket could cause excess noise, slipping belt, or other malfunctions. For appropriate repair or replacement procedures, refer to para. 8-23.

18. Check for proper engine idle speeds and adjust if necessary (para. 3-45).

6.5L engine 700±25 RPM 6.5L detuned engine 700±25 RPM
19. Ensure analyzer valve is in full open position and engine is at proper idle speed.

20. Initial pressure should be 150-250 psi and a flow of 2.50-3.50 gpm. If these specifications aren't present, check installation of analyzer and check power steering system (Refer to TM 9-2320-387-10).

21. With power steering system working properly, partially close analyzer valve until pressure reaches 700 psi. If flow rate varies more than 1 gpm from the initial reading, replace power steering pump (para. 8-23). 

CAUTION
Do not leave analyzer valve fully closed for more than 5 seconds. Severe damage may occur to power steering pump.

22. With engine at idle, close and open analyzer valve three times, recording pressure each time. All readings should be 1300 psi or higher, if pressure is lower, replace power steering pump (para. 8-23).

23. With analyzer valve in the open position, increase engine rpm to 1500 and record fluid flow. If fluid flow varies more than 1 gpm from initial reading, replace power steering pump (para. 8-23).

24. With engine at idle, turn steering wheel all the way left, hold in place for 5 seconds, then repeat process with steering wheel all the way right and record flow rates. If flow rate does not drop to 1 gpm or less, replace steering gearbox (para. 8-20).

25. With engine at idle, turn wheels slightly left and right and release quickly. If pressure does not increase and snap back within 2 seconds, check steering shaft and column for binding and repeat step 15. If pressure still does not increase and snap back, replace steering gearbox (para. 8-20).

26. With engine at idle, push brake pedal down and hold. Record pressure. If pressure varies more than 50 psi from step 22, replace hydro-boost (para. 7-6).

27. With engine at idle, push brake pedal down and release quickly. If pressure does not increase and snap back within 2 seconds, replace hydro-boost (para. 7-6). 

28. Shut off engine. Remove power steering analyzer and restore power steering system to original configuration. 29. Bleed power steering system (para. 8-27).

You must be certain that the engine cooling system is working ok, or this test won't tell you anything. If the engine is cold, and everything is working ok, the fan should be disengaged. You can tell by gently revving the engine in neutral with the hood open. If the fan is engaged you will feel a breeze outside the driver's door. If it's disengaged, you won't feel it. If you aren't sure if it's working ok, run the tests in Paragraph 2-31.

# Procedure For Checking Transmission Fluid

1. Start engine.

2. Hold down brake pedal and move transmission.

shift lever through all ranges including reverse.

3. Engage parking brake and place shift lever in neutral. Check fluid level on dipstick.

4. Proper level is between FULL and ADD marks on dipstick.

Check fluid for a burnt smell, grit, discoloration, air bubbles, or a milky appearance.

· Burnt smell, discoloration, or grit indicates wom or damaged internal components. Notify DS
maintenance (chapter 14).

· Bubbles indicate of an overfilled system or air leaks in the system. Drain the fluid and refill to proper level (para. 5-2).

· Milky appearance is due to water in the system.

Replace fluid and filter.

If the speedometer works but the vehicle doesn't move, the transmission is OK and the problem is in the transfer case. Most likely the fault is in the splined output shafts of the transfer case. Listen for unusual noise.

# 1 2-45. Dca Troubleshooting I

These diagnostic connector assembly tests can be run any time you think there is a problem with the vehicle's DCA or its on-board transducers. Do not use this paragraph to test the STE/ICE-R and its cables and transducers. Refer to TM 9-4910-571-12&P to test the STWICE-Ft. This paragraph will also supply instructions on how to use the STUICE-R in the TK mode to substitute for tests run through the DCA. 

The HMMWV is equipped with three transducers - the pulse tachometer, the fuel pressure transducer, and the current shunt. A power test (12, 13) or rpm test (10) use the pulse tachometer. The fuel pressure test (24) uses the pressure transducer. All of the starting circuit tests and battery tests done through the DCA use the shunt. Check to see that the wires are connected to the transducer for the test you're trying to run. There is a four-wire connector for the fuel pressure transducer, a two-wire connector for the pulse tachometer, and there are four wires connected to the shunt in addition to the battery cables. 

The fold-out page FP-29 gives a cross reference between DCA tests and Transducer Kit tests. 

Use this cross reference to find out how to substitute TK tests for DCA tests if you have a bad DCA. The Location of Parts page has a schematic of the HMMWV DCA. 

![653_image_0.png](653_image_0.png)

REFERENCE INFORMATION 
NOTE 
The diagnostics in this chapter assume you have already run a test through the DCA. If you haven't run a test and are here to test the entire DCA, run Tests 10 (RPM), 24 **(Fuel Pressure), and 80 (Battery** 
Current). Make note of the results for later. 

If YOIJ want to test the entire DCA harness. answer YES here and then return and answer NO when you've finished the test chain. Answer NO here to test the shunt. 

Answer NO here to test the pulse tachometer. 

Repair wiring (para. 4-80) or replace transducer (para. 4-30).

a. SIX/ICE-R Description and Operation. The following describes the operation of the Simplified Test Equipment/Internal Combustion Engines-Reprogrammable WE/ICE-R1 system and contains detailed operating procedures. It is used to test the serviceability of HMMWV vehicles and to perform primary fault detection and isolation. At& the technician has identified a faulty part or subsystem, he is referred to' a paragraph number for replacement or repair procedures for individual parts. 

b. Description **and Operatim.** STEACE-R is a testing system that performs tests and measurements on internal combustion engines. SlWICE-R measures standard voltage, current, resistance, pressure, temperature, and speed. Special tests, such as compression balance tests and starter system evaluations, are performed by STlYICE-R. Standard equipment functions, including vacuum pressure gauge, compression gauge, lowcurrent tester and multimeter, are features of the STEACE-R set. STE/ICE-R is portable and operates on either **12.** or 24.volt vehicle batteries or equivalent power source. The STEJCE-R system consists of a Vehicle Test Meter WTM), a Transducer Kit (TK), four electrical cables, a transit case, and technical publications. 

c. Vehicle Test Meter. 

L General. The VTM provides a method for the technician to test vehicle electrical and mechanical components. Readings are either pass/fail indications or digital displays in units familiar to the technician (psi, rpm, volts, ohms, amps, etc.). The Diagnostic Connector Assembly (DCA) is permanently mounted in the vehicle and provides accessibility to the most frequently needed test points. The use of the VTM through the DCA is referred to as DCA mode. The VTM interfaces with the vehicle directly with a transducer(s) from the Transducer Kit (TK). The use of the VTM through the TK is referred to as TK mode. The DCA and the TK 
can be used at the same time. This may be necessary when the diagnostic connector assembly has a missing transducer. If a transducer is missing, a no sensor indication (E002) is displayed when a measurement is made. If this happens, the TK mode can be used to make the measurement. The use of the VTM through the DCA and TK is referred to as the combined mode. Additional tests can be done that involve manually probing and/or connecting transducers to appropriate test points. Operating power for the VTM is drawn from the vehicle batteries or some equivalent battery source. Power is routed to the VTM through the DCA connected to the battery. The STE/ICE-R general purpose testing capabilities that may be applied to the vehicle are: 
O-1,000 psi pressure, O-45 volts DC, and 0-40k ohms resistance. The following control functions can be performed in conjunction with the special tests: Interleave (displays rpm with next test), Display Maximum Value, Display Minimum Value, and Display Peak-to-Peak Value. 

2. Controls and Indicators. The controls and readout display on the VTM are illustrated. The following paragraphs describe how the controls are used and how the display functions: 
(a) Power Switch (PUSH ON/PULL OFF). The power switch controls DC power to the VTM. The WM can operate from a 12.or 24volt battery system. When the power switch is pushed in (PUSH ON), the VTM power is on. To shut the VTM off, pull out the power switch (PULL OFF). The power switch contains a Pamp circuit breaker. The power switch will pop out automatically if something is wrong which causes the VTM to use more power than it should. If the switch pops out, check your hookup carefully and try again before returning the VTM to direct support maintenance. 

(b) TEST SELECT Switches. The TEST SELECT switches are used to select the actual test to be performed. There are 10 positions on each switch numbered 0 through 9. The number dialed into these switches is read by the WM when you press the test button. Changing the TEST SELECT switch positions has no effect until the TEST button is pushed. 

(cl TEST Button. Depressing and releasing the TEST button causes the test measurement to begin. 

Observe the measured value on the readout display. The reading will be in units normally used for the particular vehicle measurement. These units are listed on the flip cards. The TEST button must be pressed and immediately released. Depressing and holding the TEST button down initiates an offset test. Offset tests are described in TM 9-4910-571-12&P. 

## 1 2-46. Ste/Ice-R Test Procedures (Cont'D)

(d) Readout Display. The readout display will show different types of readouts during testing up to a maximum of four characters (for example, .8.8.8.8). The types of readouts are described in detail in paragraph 3andaresumma rized as follows: 
(1) Status Readout. This type of readout keeps the technician informed of what is happening, such as power applied, failed test, etc. 

(2) Numerical Readout. This type of readout is the measured value in units of the measurement being made. If you are measurin g O-45 volts DC, the number 24 on the display indicates 24 volts. 

(3) **E&-or** Readout. This type of readout indicates that the wrong t&t number was selected, the transducer is not connected, or the VTM is faulty. 

(e) Flip Cards. The flip cards list the 2-digit test number system for selecting the various tests. The cards also summarize the test and operating instructions contained herein. 

(0 Power/DCA **Connector Jl.** Connector Jl connects the VI'h4 to either a vehicle diagnostic connector using the DCA cable or to the vehicle batteries using the power cable. Operating power and signals from the installed transducers are supplied to the VTM through the DCA cable.

(g)  Transducer Cable Connectors J2, J3. Connectors J2 or J3 connect the VTM to any transducer in the transducer kit. Operating power is supplied to the transducer and signals from the transducers are supplied to the VTM through the cable. Connectors J2 and J3 are identical and can be interchanged with each other or used in combination.

(h)  Test Probe Cable Connector J4. Connector J4 connects test leads to the VTM when doing manual voltage resistance tests.

3. Readouts. The following paragraphs describe the different types of readouts that can occur during 

![691_image_0.png](691_image_0.png)

testing. 

(a) Status Readout. A status readout keeps the technician informed about what is happening. For example, .8.8.8.8 is displayed each time the power switch is pushed on. It means that power is applied, and that all elements of the display are operative. It changes to --- 1.5 seconds later, indicating that the VTh4 is ready to be used for testing. The status readout displays are described in table 2-2. 

(b) Prompting Message. A prompting message is a technician action message. It is a signal for you to 

![691_image_1.png](691_image_1.png)

do something such as crank the engine. For example, UJZH tells you to enter the vehicle type identification number into the VTM. After the technical action is performed, the test will automatically continue. Prompting messages are listed in table 2-3. 

(c) Numerical Readout. A numerical readout is the measured value in units of the measurement 

![691_image_2.png](691_image_2.png)

being made. For example, if you are measuring O-45 volts DC, 12.7 is volts DC. If you are measuring O-25 psig pressure, 12.7 is psig. The units for each test are listed on the flip card. The numbers displayed in the VTM are always positive unless there is a minus shown to make them negative. 

# [ 2-46. Ste/Ice-R Test Procedures **(Cont'D)** I

(d) Error Readout. EOOl is a typical error readout. There are 15 different readouts. All error readouts start with E. An error readout is a warning that you forgot to connect the transducer, selected a wrong test number, failed to start the engine, etc. All of the error messages mean you must correct the problem before continuing testing. Error readouts are listed in table 2-4. If the error message does not go away after corrective action, refer to TM 9-4910-571-12&P. 

(e) Confidence Error Readouts. COO4 is a typical error readout resulting from the detection of a faulty VTM during confidence test. For detailed information concerning confidence error readouts, refer to TM 9-4910-571-1&P.

#### D. Cable Assemblies.

L General. The **cable** assemblies are shown below and are referred to by the cable number and by a name which describes how the cable is used. If necessary, the two transducer cables (W4) can be joined with the adapter supplied in the transducer kit to make one long cable. 

![694_image_0.png](694_image_0.png)

#### Cable Assemblies

2. Installation. When cables are connected, large key on the cable connector mates with a keyway on the transducer connector or the VTM connector for proper installation. If you experience any difficulty during testing and suspect that a cable is bad, refer to TM 9-4910-571-12&P for checking cable continuity.

# 1 2-46. **Steace-R Test Procedures (Cont'D)** 1

L General. The transducer kit contains a pulse tachometer transducer, a pressure and a vacuum transducer, and the necessary adapters (bushing, plugs, tees, etc.). Also included in the kit is a current probe for measuring current and a test probe cable for measuring voltage and resistance. Not all fittings have part number markings. The legend will help to identify the items. 

Before installing any transducer kit item on the vehicle, be sure to clean the mounting surfaces. This is particularly important if you are going to open fuel lines or tap into manifolds. Dirt particles entering the engine can cause damage to both the engine and the transducer kit item. The transducers should kept clean, free of dirt and grease, and handled with reasonable care. 

2. Pressure **Transducer. The** pressure transducers have a small breather hole on the side of the housing which should be kept unplugged. Do not use high pressure. 

3. **Pulse Tachometer.** Make sure that the slotted hole in the engine tachometer driveshaft is clear and not hard-packed before installing the pulse tachometer. 

4. Threaded Adapters. Observe threaded fittings carefully to avoid engaging straight threads with pipe threads. Each measurement device (transducer) in the transducer kit has its own identification resistor. The VTM uses this identification resistor to check that the correct transducer is connected for the measurement being made. If the correct transducer is not connected, error code E002 will be displayed.

a. General. To troubleshoot a vehicle problem, the technician can use the STE/ICE-R (vehicle test meter and transducers) and the vehicle test card. 

b. Data Entry Tests. For information regarding Data Entry, Cylinder Entry, VID Entry, and Data Display Tests, refer to TM 9-4910-571-12&P. 

c. Offset **Tests. The** STEACE-R VTM performs a test by setting the TEST select switches to the test number and pressing the TEST button. For some tests, an offset test is required before the test itself can be performed. This is done by selecting the number of the desired test and holding the TEST button down for several seconds; The offset test nullities characteristic differences in the VTM, test leads, and transducers. It zeros the meter. Once the offset is performed, the VTM automatically corrects for the offset before displaying measured values. The displayed offset value should be checked against limits on the vehicle test card. If the displayed value is outside these limits, either the transducer or the test cable is faulty and must be replaced. This is another form of self-test. The offset is performed when each transducer is connected. All tests requiring offset are identified by an asterisk (*) on the flip cards and by OFFSET LIMITS on the vehicle test cards. The offset test is performed with the test probe cable or transducer connected to the VTM. Care should be taken to see that no stimulus is applied to the transducer. Test probe cable leads should be shorted together. To perform an offset test, dial the test number into the TEST SELECT switches. Press and hold the TEST button until the prompting message CAL appears on the display. A few seconds after release of the TEST button, a number will appear. This is the measured offset value associated with the test probe cable or transducer and cable. 

d. Control Tests. These tests are used to change (or control) the way a vehicle test is displayed or the way it is run. There are four control tests: 
01 Interleave (displays rpm with next test). 

02 Display Minimum Value for next test. 

03 Display Maximum Value for next test. 

04 Display Peak-to-Peak Value for next test. Control tests 01, 02, 03, and 04 specify the action to be taken by the next test only. 

A subsequent test will reset the control. 

1. Interleave **(Test 01). This** test alternately measures engine speed and a second parameter such as fuel pressure or alternator voltage. To initiate interleave, dial 01 into the TEST SELECT switches and press and release the TEST button. The prompting message PASS will signal the technician to dial in the second test number and again press and release the TEST button. 

2. **Minimum Value (Test 02).** This test displays the minimum value measured during a test. To initiate a minimum value display, dial 02 into the TEST SELECT switches and press and release the TEST button. The prompting message PASS will signal the technician to dial in the desired test number and again press and release the TEST button. The minimum value is displayed and updated whenever a lower minimum value is measured. Entering 02 and the test number again will reset the process and a new minimum value will be displayed. 

# 2-47. Vehicle Testing (Cont'D)

3. Maximum Value (Test 03). This test displays the maximum value measured during a test. To initiate a maximum value display, dial 03 into the TEST SELECT switches and press and release the TEST 
button. The prompting message PASS will signal the technician to dial in the desired test number and again press and release the TEST button. The maximum value is displayed and updated whenever a higher maximum value is measured. Entering 03 and the test number again will reset the process and a new maximum value will be displayed. 

4. Peak-to-Peak Value (Test 04). This test displays the peak-to-peak value of O-45 volts DC (891, O-1,500 amps DC (901, and battery volts (67). To start a peak-to-peak measurement, dial 04 into the TEST 
SELECT switches and press the TEST button. The prompting message PASS will signal the operator to dial in one of the three numbers (89,90,67) and again press the TEST button.

## Initial Setup:

Tools General mechanic's tool kit:
automotive (Appendix B, Item 1)
Maintenance and repair shop equipment:
automotive (Appendix B, Item 2)
Materials/Parts Detergent (Appendix C, Item 25)
Manual References TM 9-2320-387-10 TM 9-2320-387-24P
Equipment Condition Hood raised and secured (TM 9-2320-387-10).

General Safety Instructions
- Do not use unauthorized cleaning methods or liquids.

- Compressed air used for cleaning purposes will not exceed 30 psi (207 kPa).

Maintenance Level Unit

- Improper cleaning methods and use of unauthorized cleaning liquids can injure personnel and cause damage to equipment. Do not use anything other than compressed air, water, and detergent to clean elements.

- If NBC contamination is suspected, consult NBC officer or NBC NCO
for appropriate handling instructions.

a. Removal

The vehicle air cleaner may be configured with either a ring clamp or over-center clamp.

1. Loosen screw (8), or unlatch and remove clamp (1), cover (2), and gasket (3) from air cleaner assembly (6).

CAUTION
Cover housing opening with screen or rag to prevent contaminants from entering air intake system and damaging engine.

2. Remove nut and washer assembly (7) and filter element (4) from stud (5) of air cleaner assembly (6). b. Inspection 1. Check gasket (3) for dents, tears, rips, and other damage. Ensure gasket has not taken a set.

Ensure there are no hard dirt ridges on sealing surfaces.

2. Inspect filter element (4) for holes and tears by looking through element toward a bright light. If pinpoints of light shine through, replace element. Holes that are large enough to let light through are large enough to let contaminants through. Another way to check for leaks or damage is to look for uneven dirt patterns. Ensure there is no rust or flaking paint on metal parts of filter. If the filter has already been cleaned three times, or if damaged, replace filter element (4).

3. Check air cleaner assembly (6) for holes, dents, rust, or any other damage that will interfere with proper sealing and allow unfiltered air to enter and destroy engine.

c. Emergency Cleaning

Do not strike ends of filter element on hard surface, or damage to filter element may result.

Remove dust or sand from filter element (4) by holding it so neither end faces ground, and gently tap around filter element (4).

d. Cleaning

Compressed air used for cleaning purposes will not exceed 30 psi (207 kPa). Use only with effective chip guarding and personnel protective equipment (goggles/shield, gloves, etc.).

1. Hold nozzle at least 1 in. (25 mm) away from element (1) and direct compressed air against clean side of element (1) (in direction opposite to normal air flow). Move air stream up and down length of pleats until dust no longer blows out.

2. Prepare a solution of five gal. warm water 80-110°F (27-43°C) and one cup of non-sudsing detergent in a container large enough to submerge element (1).

3. Immerse element (1) completely in cleaning solution, swish for two minutes, soak element (1) for 15-20 min., then swish it around again to remove contaminants.

4. Remove element (1) from the solution and let drain. 5. Rinse element (1) with cool water 35-80°F (2-27°C) from clean side to dirty side (in direction opposite to normal air flow) with a gentle stream of water no more than 40 psi (276 kPa). If the clean side of element (1) was contaminated during soak cycle, rinse from both sides.

Do not use compressed air to speed drying time or damage to element may result.

6. Air-dry element (1) at normal room temperature until it is completely dry. Usually overnight is adequate, but temperature and humidity will affect drying time. If circulating air is used, do not exceed 180°F (82°C).

7. Inspect element (1) and discard if damaged. If not damaged, mark date of cleaning on element (1).

e. Installation 1. Remove screen or rag from housing opening.

When replacing filter element, ensure it is the 420 CFM element.

2. Install filter element (1) on stud (5) of air cleaner assembly (6) with nut and washer assembly (7).

Tighten nut and washer assembly (7) to 20-40 lb-in (2-5 N•m).

# 3-61. Cooling System Servicing (Cont'D)

d. Filling System

- Type 1, ethylene glycol (green), and Type 2, propylene glycol
(purple), should never be mixed due to their difference in toxic properties. Failure to comply may result in damage to equipment.

- Using antifreeze without mixing it with water can cause high operating temperatures, blockage of cooling system passages, and damage to water pump seals.

- Type 1 antifreeze is an ethylene glycol based coolant, green in color. Type 1 can be added to factory-filled pink coolant. When it becomes necessary to flush factory coolant, Type 1, ethylene glycol, will be used. When mixing Type 1 antifreeze with water, distilled water is recommended. Tap water should only be used in emergency situations.

- The cooling system for the vehicles covered in this manual has a 26 qt
(24.6 L) capacity. Continue filling and allow air to escape. Ensure surge tank coolant level is 3/4 full before securing filler cap.

- Ensure vent hose is routed above air intake to allow for purging of air in cooling system.

1. Ensure radiator drainvalve (4) is closed and heater control valve (3) is open (pull TEMP knob on dash to MAX position).

2. Fill system with proper antifreeze solution. See table 3-1 for preparation of antifreeze solutions. 3. Secure filler cap (1) to surge tank (2). 4. Run engine at fast idle (approximately 1,500 rpm) until engine temperature reaches 190°F (88°C),
opening thermostat to circulate coolant.

5. Depressurize system (see task a.). 6. Fill with proper antifreeze solution until surge tank (2) is 3/4 full. See table 3-1 for preparation of antifreeze solutions.

7. Secure filler cap (1) to surge tank (2). 8. Run engine at fast idle (approximately 1,500 rpm) until temperature reaches 190°F (88°C), opening thermostat, and stop engine.

9. Depressurize system (see task a.). Use tester to ensure proper coolant protection is provided.

Unit

Always wear eye protection when bleeding brakes. Failure to do this may cause injury if brake fluid comes in contact with eyes.

NOTE
- If only the front or rear half of the system has been serviced, it is usually necessary to bleed only that half of the system. However, if a firm brake pedal cannot be obtained after bleeding, it will be necessary to bleed the entire system. The brake hydraulic system can be bled manually or by using a pressure tank and adapters. Each method is outlined in the following procedures.

- Bleed brakes in the following order: right rear, left rear, right front, left front.

a. Pressure Bleeding

- When using a pressure bleeding tank, follow the manufacturer's instructions for its use. Do not exceed the recommended working pressure when pressurizing the tank. A tank pressure of 15-20 psi (103-138 kPa) is sufficient to bleed the brake hydraulic system. Release all air pressure from the tank after using it.

- After refilling pressure bleeding tank with silicone brake fluid, let tank sit undisturbed for 30 minutes minimum to ensure all visible as well as minute air bubbles are gone.

This procedure covers bleeding at one wheel. Repeat bleeding task for remaining wheels.

1. Remove cover from master cylinder (1). 2. Install pressure tank bleeder adapter (2) on master cylinder (1). 3. Connect line (3) from pressure tank to adapter (2).

# 7-2. Service Brake System Bleeding Instructions (Serial Numbers 299999 And Below) (Cont'D)

4. Slowly push piston (8) into master cylinder (10). Do not release piston (8). While holding piston (8),
pinch bleeder hose (7) off and release piston (8). Piston (8) will return automatically.

Whenever the master cylinder is filled with silicone brake fluid, let cylinder sit undisturbed for 30 minutes minimum to ensure all visible as well as minute air bubbles are gone.

5. Refill reservoirs (6) with silicone brake fluid and repeat steps 3 and 4 until no air bubbles remain in brake fluid.

6. Remove two bleeder hose (7) from brake line ports on master cylinder (10). 7. Install cover (5) on master cylinder (10) and remove from vise. 8. Install master cylinder (10) (para. 7-5).

Maintenance Level Unit

The Kelsey-Hayes parking brake mechanism has an automatic adjusting feature and does not require periodic manual adjustment. When parking brake components or rear brake pads are replaced, the parking brake linkage must be initially positioned to ensure proper parking brake system operation. The only additional adjustment necessary is accomplished with parking brake hand lever. Refer to TM 9-2320-387-10.

## Adjustment

1. Remove clip (1) and spread boot (2) to allow access to cotter pin (9). 2. Remove cotter pin (9), washer (8), and clevis pin (4) from clevis (5) and bellcrank (3). Discard cotter pin (9).

3. Repeatedly apply and adjust parking brake hand lever until bellcrank (3) linear travel is 0.75 in.

(19 mm).

Holes in parking brake clevis must align to holes in adjusting bellcrank without force for proper parking brake adjustment. Failure to do this may result in damage to equipment and poor performance.

4. Release parking brake. Loosen nut (6) and adjust clevis (5) so holes in clevis (5) align to holes in bellcrank (3). Install clevis (5) on bellcrank (3) with clevis pin (4), washer (8), and cotter pin (9).

Do not overtighten brake rod. Overtightening brake rod may result in dragging brakes.

5. If necessary, remove excess slack in parking brake cables by turning parking brake rod (7)
clockwise or counterclockwise into clevis (5).

# 7-19. Rear Dual Service/Parking Brake Adjustment (Cont'D)

Ensure caliper cable bracket is secure with no signs of looseness and lever is in contact with caliper cable bracket stop. Damage to equipment and poor performance will result if not aligned properly.

Perform step 6 on both sides.

- It is not necessary to perform rear wheel toe-out alignment prior to the scheduled semiannual or 3,000 mile (4,827 km) maintenance interval unless abnormal vehicle handling or control is reported, or it is directed by another maintenance task.

- Rear wheel alignment adjustments other than toe-out are performed by DS maintenance (chapter 21).

- Ensure M1113 models have S250 shelter installed before performing rear wheel toe-out alignment.

## A. Preliminary Inspection

1. Check all tires (7) for uniform tread wear. 2. Raise vehicle and place support under lower control arms (11). 3. Check geared hubs (5) for output spindle end play by grasping edges of tires (7) and attempting to move tires (7) up and down. Adjust spindle bearings (para. 6-12) if any spindle movement is apparent.

4. Inspect for looseness of upper ball joint (3) by visually inspecting ball joint boot, and replace upper ball joint (3) if boot is ripped or torn.

4.1. Grasp top of tire (6) and attempt to move tire IN and OUT. Observe upper control arm (2) and gear hub (4) where upper ball joint (3) is mounted. If lateral movement is observed, upper ball joint (3) may be worn.

4.2. Replace upper ball joint (3) if movement is 1/8 in. (3 mm) or more (refer to para. 6-23)
5. Check for looseness of lower ball joint (7) by visually inspecting ball joint boot, and replace lower ball joint (7) if boot is ripped or torn.

# 8-10. Rear Wheel Toe-Out Alignment (Cont'D)

b. Toe-out Check

- To ensure proper alignment, vehicle must be at curb weight, or gross vehicle weight.

- Vehicle should not be moved during alignment checks. - Vehicle must be on level ground with wheels set straight ahead. - Steps 1 through 3 will determine centerline of tire. - Point of measurement for checking toe-out will be where lines marked in steps 1 and 3 intersect.

1. Mark line (4) on center tread (1) of tire (2) 16-1/2-in. (42 cm) from ground. 2. Measure total width of tire tread (3) and record. 3. Mark line (5) on center tread (1) at one-half total tread width (3). 4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 for opposite tire. 5. Measure distance between points of measurement on front side of tires (2) and record. 6. Rotate tires (2) by moving vehicle forward until points of measurement are 16-1/2 in. (42 cm) above the ground at rear side of tires (2). Repeat steps 1 through 4 for side of tires.

7. Measure distance between points of measurement on rear side of tires (2) and record.

- If measurement is larger on rear side of tires than measurement on front side of tires, tires have toe-in.

- If toe-out alignment does not meet specifications, repeat checking procedures to eliminate any possible reading errors.

8. Subtract meaurement obtained in step 7 for rear side of tires (2) from measurement obtained in step 5 for front side of tires (2). The result of this subtraction represents inches of toe-out. Refer to table 8-2 for toe-out specifications. If toe-out does not meet the specifications, adjust toe-out (task c.).

Adjustment procedures for left and right turn radius are the same. This procedure covers the left side.

1. Place the transmission in neutral and start the engine, allowing the engine to operate at idle speed.

If the stop bolt hits the axle under pressure, release the wheel immediately. Damage to steering components may result.

2. Turn the steering wheel to a full left turn. 3. Check clearance between stop bolt and axle. If clearance is not 1/8", plunger adjustment will be necessary.

4. Turn the steering wheel so tires are straight ahead.

- Turning the plunger in will increase the clearance between the stop bolt and axle.

- Turning the plunger out will decrease the clearance between the stop bolt and axle.

Never adjust the plunger beyond flush with the end cap. Leakage or personal injury may result.

Do not adjust the plunger with pressure on the steering wheel, seal damage can result.

5. Adjust the plunger for left turn. 6. Turn the steering wheel to a full left turn. Check the clearance between the stop bolt and axle. If clearance is not 1/8", repeat steps 4 through 6.

# 8-20. Steering Gear Maintenance (Serial Numbers 246889 **And Below) (Cont'D)**

## A.1. Steering Gear Mounting Area Inspection (M1114 Only) Note

The inspection is focused on the area surrounding the steering gear mounting tubes, commonly referred to as bosses. They are located on the front left-hand frame rail. Tubes are welded in holes through the frame rail, accommodating the steering gear mounting bolts. Inside and outside frame rails have experienced stress-cracking stemming from the steering gear mounting tubes. Stress cracks can be radial, tangential, transverse, and/or longitudinal. In some cases, stress cracks can be in the boss welds themselves.

Inspect steering gear mounting area as follows:

It may be necessary to remove all paint on suspected area.

(a) Inspect all welds around bosses on inside and outside frame rails. (b) Inspect for cracks on all surfaces between all bosses on inside, outside, top, and bottom of frame rails.

Most cracks in boss welds and frame rails are repairable. Upon identification, notify general support maintenance for repairs.

(c) Unless follow-on repairs are required, if paint was removed during inspection, spot-paint using Chemical Agent Resistant Coating (CARC). Follow TM 43-0139, Painting Instructions for Field Use.

| If pump is noisy, recheck hoses for possible contact with vehicle                                       |
| body or engine. If no contact is found and noise continues, turn                                        |
| engine off and repressurize system by following steps 9 and/or 10.                                      |
| 9.  Remove reservoir cap. Wait for system to cool. Reinstall reservoir cap. Start engine (TM 9\-2320\-  |
| 387\-10) and check pump for noise. If noise is still present, continue to step 10. If noise stopped,    |
| proceed to step 11.                                                                                     |
| 10.  Turn engine off (TM 9\-2320\-387\-10). Remove fluid from reservoir using a suction device. Refill  |
| reservoir with clean, cool fluid. Install reservoir cap. Start engine (TM 9\-2320\-387\-10) and check   |
| pump for noise. If noise is still present, replace power steering pump (para. 8\-23).                   |

Ground Glow plug power relay (in the Protective Control Box) applies battery power to glow plugs when all three thermal breakers are closed.  You can hear this relay clicking Wait-to-start lamp control relay (in the Protective Control Box): when the glow plug cycle timer trips, this relay forces the wait-to-start lamp to stay off  until the vehicle is turned off.
NOTES ABOUT THERMAL
CIRCUIT BREAKERS
Thermal circuit breakers act like switches that open when their temperature goes above a set temperature.  They are closed below that temperature.

Each of these thermal circuit breakers also has a small heater, shown as a resistor.

The temperature the breaker feels is the heat of the engine coolant plus the heat of the heater.

E indicates engine connector, B indicates body connector

Wait-to-start lamp  (next to the rotary switch on dash): comes on when the rotary switch is turned to 'run'.  The colder the engine, the longer the lamp will stay on, but never more than 9 seconds.  The lamp will not come on at all if the engine temperature is above 120° F (49°C).  The lamp should not come on again unless the switch is turned to the 'stop' position and then
