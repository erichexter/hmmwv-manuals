- Headache - Dizziness - Sleepiness - Loss of muscular control 5. If you see another person with exhaust poisoning symptoms:
- Remove person from area - Expose to open air - Keep person warm - Do not permit physical exercise - Administer artificial respiration, if necessary* - Notify a medic
*For artificial respiration, refer to FM 21-11.

6. BE AWARE, the field protective mask for nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) protection will not protect you from carbon monoxide poisoning. THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST EXHAUST POISONING IS ADEQUATE VENTILATION.

## Warning Summary

- Hood must be supported during removal and installation and hood prop rod and bracket replacement.

Failure to support hood may cause injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- Diesel fuel is highly flammable. Do not perform this procedure near fire, flames, or sparks. Severe injury or death will result.

- Do not touch hot exhaust system components with bare hands. Severe injury will result. - Windshield must be supported during removal and installation. Failure to support windshield may cause injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- Winch must be supported during removal and installation. Failure to support winch may cause severe injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- Gloves must be worn whenever handling winch cable. Severe injury may result. - Opening one end of cargo door before ensuring opposite end is securely closed will cause both ends to open simultaneously, resulting in injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- Rear steps must be raised before disconnecting retractor lever from rear steps. Failure to do this may cause injury to personnel and damage to equipment.

- NBC contaminated filters must be handled and disposed of only by authorized and trained personnel.

The unit commander or senior officer in charge of maintenance personnel must ensure that prescribed protective clothing (FM 3-4) is used, and prescribed safety measures and decontamination procedures (FM 3-5) are followed. The local unit SOP is responsible for final disposal of contaminated air filters. Failure to do this may cause severe injury to personnel.

automotive (Appendix B, Item 1) **Manual References**

The M998 series body is constructed from aluminum alloys that have been heat treated to obtain high strength. Welding cannot be used to make body repairs. Heat generated in welding will reverse the heat treatment process and cause a great reduction in strength of material. Solid 3/16 inch diameter aluminum rivets are the primary method of joining body components. Rivets are inserted into a hole through two pieces of metal and a second head is formed by manual or pneumatic impacting. or by squeezing the rivet. A bucking bar is used to backup the rivet to form rivet head. When making repairs, use blind rivets of the same size or oversize diameter with the appropriate grip length. Blind structural aluminum rivets of 3/16 inch diameter are used in applications where there is access from only one side of the part. Blind rivets are installed using a tool that pulls on the rivet stem causing a bulbed head to form on the back side of the part. Fastening is complete when stem breaks off. High strength is obtained in blind structural rivets by mechanically locking the remaining stem inside rivet body. Blind pop rivets are used in locations where non-structural attachments such as latches, striker plates, etc., are attached to the body.

3.

Steel pull-type lockbolt fasteners in 3/16 and 1/4-inch diameter are used where tension or high shear loads exist. Lockbolts are two-piece unthreaded fasteners. One part is a high-strength, steel-headed bolt-like part with aberrations on its shank. The mating part is a collar which is swaged over the serrations causing the fastener to be locked in place. Rivnut/plusnut fasteners are tubular rivets with internal threads. Rivnut/plusnut fasteners are installed using a tool that engages the threads of the fastener and extends a pull, causing the shank to expand tightly against the material being fastened. This process is called "upsetting" a rivnut/plusnut.

6.

Rivet and Lockbolt replacement. To facilitate repairs to body, it is acceptable to replace lockbolts and rivets with 1/4 inch AN4 series bolts. Do not replace lockbolts with rivets. Standard threaded fasteners should not be used, as these will quickly wear the aluminum structure. Bolt lengths should be chosen so that the cylindrical portion of bolt is bearing on all members being joined. Bolts are designated as AN4-XX or AN4C-XX where XX defines grip length. Tighten all bolts to 70-75 lb-in. (8-9 N.m).

Fatigue strength of riveted joints and seams is increased by one part epoxy adhesive. This adhesive requires special material storage and metal preparation along with a low temperature heat cycle for curing. Because of its impracticality in field repairs, epoxy adhesive will not be used. Where possible, extra rivets and thicker metal gages should be used instead of adhesives. When making repairs, note epoxy exists and that parts may be difficult to separate, even after rivets are removed.

7.

### 10-66. Body Repair (Cont'D)

1. The damaged area should be thoroughly cleaned and inspected to determine cause and extent of damage. Body parts should be inspected for holes, cracks, dents, distortion, or breaks. Fasteners should be inspected for breaks, stretching, looseness, cocked heads, or hole elongation. Seams, flanges, and joints should be inspected for straightness or local deformation as an indication that fasteners may have been stretched or holes elongated. It is possible for this to happen and fasteners still appear to be tight in their holes. In addition, make thorough inspection of adjacent areas to determine if high loads have been transmitted from the damaged area to other areas. This can result in secondary damage in the form of distorted panels or seams, loosened or sheared fasteners, elongated fastener holes, and cracks.

2. Signs of rivet failure include tipped heads, looseness, and sometimes chipped or cracked paint. If heads are tipped in the same direction and rivets are loose in consecutive groups, the joint has undergone excessive load. Rivet heads which are tipped in different directions and are not in groups may be improperly installed. With chipped or cracked paint, it may be necessary to remove paint to check true condition of rivets. Rivets subjected to critical loads but showing no distortion, should be inspected if failure is suspected. The head should be drilled off, and the shank should be carefully punched out. Failure is indicated by notched rivet shank and misaligned holes. Flush rivets showing head slippage within the dimple or countersink indicate either sheet bearing or rivet shear failure and must be removed for inspection and replacement. If failure of rivets cannot be detected by visual inspection, the joint can be checked by drilling and punching out several rivets. If rivet shanks are notched, rivets should be replaced with next larger size rivets. If rivet holes show elongation due to local failure in tearing of the sheet, next larger size rivet must be used in replacement. Any deformation of the sheet around the rivet, tear outs, or cracks between rivets usually indicates partially failed or damaged rivets. Complete repair of the joint will require replacement by next larger size rivets. Use the next 1/32 inch larger diameter rivet to obtain a tight joint when original hole has been enlarged. If original size rivet is installed, the rivet would not be able to carry its share of the shear load, and the joint would not meet its strength requirement.

### C. Rivet Replacement Note

When removing rivets, care should be taken to not enlarge rivet hole as this would require use of an oversize or larger rivet for replacement.

### 1. Solid Rivet Removal.

(a)
File a flat surface on the manufactured head if accessible, It is always preferable to work on manufactured head rather than the one that is bucked over, since the former will always be more symmetrical about the shank.

Indent center of the filed surface with a center punch. Drill through rivet head. Be sure to use a drill slightly smaller than diameter of rivet shank to avoid making rivet hole oversized. Shear weakened rivet head off with a sharp chisel. For this operation, support back side of rivet and cut rivet head along direction of rivet line or panel edge. This will prevent distortion of the panel.

Firmly support the panel from the opposite side and drive out shank with a pin punch. If rivet is unduly tight because of swelling between sheets, drill rivet shank out with an undersize drill.

2. Blind Rivet Removal.

(b) (c)
(d)
(e)
(a) File a small flat on rivet head.

(b) Center punch the flat. Support rivet backside, if possible.

## 10-66. Body Repair (Cont'D)

(d) Shear lock using a pin punch to drive out pin.

(e) Pry out remainder of locking collar.

(f) Using a drill slightly smaller than rivet shank, drill almost through rivet head.

(g) Pry off rivet head with a pin punch.

(h) Tap out rivet shank with a pin punch.

3. Rivnut/Plusnut Removal.

(a) Drill through rivnut head. (b) Punch out shank.

4. Rivet Hole Drilling.

(a) Center punch all new rivet locations. Center punch mark must be large enough to prevent drill from slipping out of position, yet it must not dent the surface of the material. To prevent denting, place a bucking bar behind material during punching.

(b) Make sure drill is the correct size (tables 10-1 and 10-2) and point is properly ground. A no. 10 drill is used to install standard 3/16-inch blind rivets.

When using a power drill, give the bit a few turns with fingers before starting motor. This will help assure that drill does not jump out of position when motor is started.

# 10-66. Body Repair (Cont'D) I

- While drilling, hold drill at 90 degree angle to material surface.

Avoid letting drill wobble, marking oblong holes.

- Avoid excessive pressure. Let drill bit do the cutting.

- Do not push drill through material.

Remove all burrs with a metal countersink or file.

Clean away all drill chips. Care must be taken to assure that no chips are trapped between sheets of metal.

Apply sealing compound to hole and surrounding area.

5. Hole Countersinking.

Some rivet installations in the body require that rivet head be flush with the material surface. In these instances, countersunk or flush head rivets are used.

When using countersunk rivets, rivet holes must be countersunk with a tool having a 100" taper so rivet head will fit flush with surface.

When using a hand-operated countersink, the hole must be tried with a rivet so the recess will not be too deep or too shallow. It is best to use a countersink with a stop on it so depth of countersink can be controlled. Typical countersinking dimensions for blind rivets are shown in table 10-3. The minimum sheet thickness that can be machined for 100° countersink rivets is given in table 10-4.

Do not remove edge of hole on blind side of joint.

6. Blind Rivet Driving Practices and Precautions.

(a) Rivets should be inspected for proper installation. The grip length of each rivet is marked on top of its head to provide positive identification. Use of proper grip length will produce a rivet installation where locking collar is flush with top surface of rivet head. Tolerance limit on flushness is 0.020 in. (0.5 mm).

(b) For proper rivet installation, it is imperative that holes be properly prepared, tools be in good working order, and rivets properly applied. When problems occur, the source of trouble could be in any of these areas.

7. Blind Rivet Installation.

- Prior to installing blind rivets, the hole must be prepared, the parts aligned and clamped firmly in place. These steps are the same as for solid riveting operations. Proper drill sizes for standard and oversized blind rivets are given in table 10-2.

Countersinking dimensions and minimum sheet gage for countersunk blind rivets are shown in tables 10-3 and 10-4.

. It is very important that the proper length rivet is selected for each application. Rivet lengths are sized by the range of material thickness that the rivet will grip. Selecting the proper rivet length is critical because rivets can tolerate only 1/16 inch variation in material thickness for each particular rivet length.

Rivet grip lengths are called out as a "dash number" at the end of the manufacturer's part number. Grip lengths are determined as shown in table 10-5.

- For double dimpled sheets, add countersunk head height to materials thickness.

- Use rivet installation tool kit for all blind rivets.

(a) Insert rivet stem into pulling head of rivet gun. (b) Hold rivet gun in line with axis of rivet as accurately as possible. (c) Apply a shady firm pressure against rivet head.

(d) Squeeze handles of manual gun. The rivet clamping action will pull sheets together, seat rivet head, and break stem flush with head of rivet.

8. Rivnut/Plusnut/Insertnut Installation.

(a) Thread rivnut onto mandrel of installation tool.

(b) Insert rivnut into hole for installation. (c) Apply steady firm pressure against rivnut head. (d) Squeeze hades of tool to clinch rivnut shank against material. (e) Remove mandrel from rivnut.

# Appendix B Maintenance Allocation Chart

Section I. INTRODUCTION

## B-1. The Army Maintenance System (Mac)

a. This section provides a general explanation of all maintenance and repair functions authorized at various maintenance levels under the standard Army Maintenance System Concept.

b. The Maintenance Allocation Chart (MAC) in section II designates overall authority and responsibility for the performance of maintenance functions on the identified end item or component. The application of the maintenance functions to the end item or component will be consistent with the capacities and capabilities of the designated maintenance levels, which are shown on the MAC in column (4) as:
Unit - includes two subcolumns, C (operator/crew ) and O 
(unit) maintenance.

Direct Support - includes an F subcolumn. General Support - includes an H subcolumn. Depot - includes a D subcolumn.

c. Section III lists the tools and test equipment (both special tools and common tool sets) required for each maintenance function as referenced from section II.

d. Section IV contains supplemental instructions and explanatory notes for a particular maintenance function.

## B-2. Maintenance Functions

Maintenance functions will be limited to and defined as follows:
a. Inspect. To determine the serviceability of an item by comparing its physical, mechanical, and/or electrical characteristics with established standards through examination (e.g., by sight, sound, or feel).

b. Test. To verify serviceability by measuring the mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, or electrical characteristics of an item and comparing those characteristics with prescribed standards.

c. Service. Operations required periodically to keep an item in proper operating condition, i.e., to clean
(includes decontaminate, when required), to preserve, to drain, to paint, or to replenish fuel, lubricants, chemical fluids, or gases.

d. Adjust. To maintain or regulate, within prescribed limits, by bringing into proper or exact position, or by setting the operating characteristics to specified parameters.

e. Align. To adjust specified variable elements of an item to bring about optimum or desired performance.

f. Calibrate. To determine and cause corrections to be made or to be adjusted on instruments or test, measuring, and diagnostic equipment used in precision measurement. Consists of comparisons of two instruments, one of which is a certified standard of known accuracy, to detect and adjust any discrepancy in the accuracy of the instrument being compared.

g. Remove/Install. To remove and install the same item when required to perform service or other maintenance functions. Install may be the act of emplacing, seating, or fixing into position a spare, repair part, or module (component or assembly) in a manner to allow the proper functioning of an equipment or system.

h. Replace. To remove an unserviceable item and install a serviceable counterpart in its place.

"Replace" is authorized by the MAC and is shown as the 3d position code of the SMR code.

i. Repair. The application of maintenance services, including fault location/troubleshooting, removal/installation, and disassembly/assembly procedures, and maintenance actions to identify troubles and restore serviceability to an item by correcting specific damage, fault, malfunction, or failure in a part, subassembly, module (component or assembly), end item, or system.

j. Overhaul. That maintenance effort (service/action) prescribed to restore an item to a completely serviceable/operational condition as required by maintenance standards in appropriate technical publications (i.e., DMWR). Overhaul is normally the highest degree of maintenance performed by the Army. Overhaul does not normally return an item to like-new condition.

k. Rebuild. Consists of those services/actions necessary for the restoration of unserviceable equipment to a like-new condition in accordance with original manufacturing standards. Rebuild is the highest degree of materiel maintenance applied to Army equipment. The rebuild operation includes the act of returning to zero those age measurements (hours/ miles, etc.) considered in classifying Army equipment/components.

## B-3. Explanation Of Columns In The Mac, Section Ii

a. Column (1)-Group Number. Column 1 lists functional group code numbers, the purpose of which is to identify maintenance significant components, assemblies, subassemblies, and modules with the next higher assembly.

b. Column (2)-Component/Assembly. Column 2 contains the names of components, assemblies, subassemblies, and modules for which maintenance is authorized.

c. Column (3)-Maintenance Function. Column 3 lists the functions to be performed on the item listed in Column 2. (For detailed explanation of these functions, see para. B-2.)
d. Column (4)-Maintenance Category. Column 4 specifies, by the listing of a work time figure in the appropriate subcolumn(s), the category of maintenance authorized to perform the function listed in Column 3. This figure represents the active time required to perform that maintenance function at the indicated category of maintenance. If the number of complexity of the tasks within the listed maintenance function vary at different maintenance categories, appropriate work time figures will be shown for each category. The work time figure represents the average time required to restore an item (assembly, subassembly, component, module, end item, or system) to a serviceable condition under typical field operating conditions. This time includes preparation time (including any necessary disassembly/assembly time) troubleshooting/fault location time, and quality assurance/quality control time in addition to the time required to perform the specific tasks identified for the maintenance functions authorized in the maintenance allocation chart. The symbol designations for the various maintenance categories are as follows:

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| removal/installation, and disassembly/assembly procedures, and maintenance actions to identify troubles                   |
| and restore serviceability to an item by correcting specific damage, fault, malfunction, or failure in a part,            |
| subassembly, module (component or assembly), end item, or system.                                                         |
| j. Overhaul. That maintenance effort (service/action) prescribed to restore an item to a completely                       |
| serviceable/operational condition as required by maintenance standards in appropriate technical                           |
| publications (i.e., DMWR). Overhaul is normally the highest degree of maintenance performed by the                        |
| Army. Overhaul does not normally return an item to like\-new condition.                                                   |
| k. Rebuild. Consists of those services/actions necessary for the restoration of unserviceable equipment                   |
| to a like\-new condition in accordance with original manufacturing standards. Rebuild is the highest degree               |
| of materiel maintenance applied to Army equipment. The rebuild operation includes the act of returning to                 |
| zero those age measurements (hours/ miles, etc.) considered in classifying Army equipment/components.                     |

| is to identify maintenance significant components, assemblies, subassemblies, and modules with the next  higher assembly. |
| b.  Column (2)\-Component/Assembly. Column 2 contains the names of components, assemblies,                                |
| subassemblies, and modules for which maintenance is authorized.                                                           |
| c.  Column (3)\-Maintenance Function. Column 3 lists the functions to be performed on the item                            |
| listed in Column 2. (For detailed explanation of these functions, see para. B\-2.)                                        |
| d.  Column (4)\-Maintenance Category. Column 4 specifies, by the listing of a work time figure in                         |
| the appropriate subcolumn(s), the category of maintenance authorized to perform the function listed in                    |
| Column 3. This figure represents the active time required to perform that maintenance function at the                     |
| indicated category of maintenance. If the number of complexity of the tasks within the listed maintenance                 |
| function vary at different maintenance categories, appropriate work time figures will be shown for each                   |
| category. The work time figure represents the average time required to restore an item (assembly,                         |
| subassembly, component, module, end item, or system) to a serviceable condition under typical field                       |
| operating conditions. This time includes preparation time (including any necessary disassembly/assembly                   |
| time) troubleshooting/fault location time, and quality assurance/quality control time in addition to the time             |
| required to perform the specific tasks identified for the maintenance functions authorized in the                         |

Figure D-91, Winch Wire Rope Assembly

### Instructions:

1. (a) Properly seize wire rope end before cutting. To seize wire rope end, follow these instructions.

- Ensure each wrap is tight to the preceding wrap. - Ensure the length of the seizing is not less than the diameter of the wire rope.

(1) Wrap the seizing wire around the wire rope as tight as possible. (2) Twist the ends of the seizing together by hand counterclockwise so that the twist is near the middle of the seizing.

NOTE
Do not try to tighten the seizing by twisting.

(3) Tighten the twist just enough to take up the slack. (4) Tighten the seizing by prying the twist away from the axis of the wire rope. (5) Tighten the twist again as described in step (3). (6) Repeat the process until the seizing can not be pryed away from the axis of the wire rope. (7) Cut off wire ends and pound the twist into contact with the seizing.

(b) Cut wire rope to length as shown and install part of clamp with nut on wire rope.

# Section Ii. Illustrated Manufacturing Instructions (Cont'D)

2. Position rope after seizing in a suitable fixture to make a loop, leaving enough rope to wrap around thimble and enclose in clamp.

3. Insert thimble and close jaws of fixture to enable rope to conform to groove of thimble. 4. Place one half of clamp in position and adjust rope accordingly. The seized portion of the wire rope should equal one rope diameter and protrude entirely beyond the threaded end of the clamp half.

5. Install clamp nut. Holding both threaded halves in position, push the nut into both halves through the first two threads. Ensure proper alignment of both threaded halves, and that there is no crossthreading.

6. Remove rope, clamp and thimble while still connected. 7. Hold opposing flats of clamp halves in suitable fixture and properly lubricate exposed threads with high-viscosity lubricating oil.

8. Using a permanent marker, mark one flat nut to ensure the same opposing flats are checked before and after tightening the clamp.

9. Using calipers, measure 1/8 inch across the flat nut from the bottom and note measurement.

10. Check to make sure clamp halves are properly secured in fixture, and tighten with appropriate wrench.

11. Using calipers, again take measurement of the same flat nuts as was done before tightening of the nut. If the increment dilation is between 0.004 and 0.007 inches, clamp is tight.

# Appendix E Torque Limits

#### E-1. General

This section provides general torque limits for screws used on the M998 series vehicles. Special torque limits are indicated in the maintenance procedures for applicable components. The general torque limits given in this appendix shall be used when specific torque limits are not indicated in the maintenance procedure.

Unless otherwise specified, standard torque tolerance shall be ± 10%. These general torque limits cannot be applied to screws that retain rubber components. The rubber components will be damaged before the correct torque limit is reached. If a special torque limit is not given in the maintenance instructions, tighten the screw or nut until it touches the metal bracket, then tighten it one more turn.

#### E-2. Torque Limits

Table E-1 lists dry torque limits. Dry torque limits are used on screws that do not have lubricants applied to the threads. Table E-2 lists wet torque limits. Wet torque limits are used on screws that have high pressure lubricants applied to the threads.

#### E-3. How To Use Torque Table

![1089_Image_0.Png](1089_Image_0.Png)

a. Measure the diameter of the screw

![1089_image_2.png](1089_image_2.png)

you are installing.

b. Count the number of threads per inch.

c. Under the heading SIZE, look down the left-hand column until you find the diameter of the screw you are installing (there will usually be two lines beginning with the same size).

d. In the second column under SIZE, find the number of threads per inch that matches the number of threads you counted in step b.

CAPSCREW HEAD MARKINGS
Manufacturer's marks may vary.

These are all SAE Grade 5
(3-line).

e.

f.

To find the grade screw you are installing, match

![1089_image_1.png](1089_image_1.png) the markings on the head to the correct picture of CAPSCREW HEAD MARKINGS on the torque table.

Look down the column under the picture you found in step e. until you find the torque limit (in lb-ft or NŽm) for the diameter and threads per inch of the screw you are installing.

|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| reading     | torque value | Length of Torque Wrench                       |

The length of the torque wrench is measured from the center of the handle to the center of the drive. The length of the adapter is measured from the center of the drive to the center of the winch.

Example:

| 1.14   |
|--------|

![1092_image_0.png](1092_image_0.png)

In this example, the torque wrench measures 22 in. (55.9 cm) and the adapter is 3 in. (7.6 cm). The required torque is 19 lb-ft (25.8 NŽm).

| 1.  (a) Properly seize wire rope end before cutting. To seize wire rope end, follow these instructions. |
| NOTE                                                                                                    |
| - Ensure each wrap is tight to the preceding wrap.                                                      |
| - Ensure the length of the seizing is not less than the diameter                                        |
| of the wire rope.                                                                                       |
| (1) Wrap the seizing wire around the wire rope as tight as possible.                                    |
| (2) Twist the ends of the seizing together by hand counterclockwise so that the twist is near the       |
| middle of the seizing.                                                                                  |
| NOTE                                                                                                    |
| Do not try to tighten the seizing by twisting.                                                          |
| (3) Tighten the twist just enough to take up the slack.                                                 |
| (4) Tighten the seizing by prying the twist away from the axis of the wire rope.                        |
| (5) Tighten the twist again as described in step (3).                                                   |
| (6) Repeat the process until the seizing can not be pryed away from the axis of the wire rope.          |
| (7) Cut off wire ends and pound the twist into contact with the seizing.                                |
| (b) Cut wire rope to length as shown and install part of clamp with nut on wire rope.                   |
