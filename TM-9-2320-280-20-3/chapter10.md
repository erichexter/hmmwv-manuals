The M998 series body is constructed from aluminum alloys that have been heat treated to obtain high strength. Welding cannot be used to make body repairs. Heat generated in welding will reverse the heat treatment process and cause a great reduction in strength of material. Solid 3/16 inch diameter aluminum rivets are the primary method of joining body components. Rivets are inserted into a hole through two pieces of metal and a second head is formed by manual or pneumatic impacting. or by squeezing the rivet. A bucking bar is used to backup the rivet to form rivet head. When making repairs, use blind rivets of the same size or oversize diameter with the appropriate grip length. Blind structural aluminum rivets of 3/16 inch diameter are used in applications where there is access from only one side of the part. Blind rivets are installed using a tool that pulls on the rivet stem causing a bulbed head to form on the back side of the part. Fastening is complete when stem breaks off. High strength is obtained in blind structural rivets by mechanically locking the remaining stem inside rivet body. Blind pop rivets are used in locations where non-structural attachments such as latches, striker plates, etc., are attached to the body.

3.

Steel pull-type lockbolt fasteners in 3/16 and 1/4-inch diameter are used where tension or high shear loads exist. Lockbolts are two-piece unthreaded fasteners. One part is a high-strength, steel-headed bolt-like part with aberrations on its shank. The mating part is a collar which is swaged over the serrations causing the fastener to be locked in place. Rivnut/plusnut fasteners are tubular rivets with internal threads. Rivnut/plusnut fasteners are installed using a tool that engages the threads of the fastener and extends a pull, causing the shank to expand tightly against the material being fastened. This process is called "upsetting" a rivnut/plusnut.

6.

Rivet and Lockbolt replacement. To facilitate repairs to body, it is acceptable to replace lockbolts and rivets with 1/4 inch AN4 series bolts. Do not replace lockbolts with rivets. Standard threaded fasteners should not be used, as these will quickly wear the aluminum structure. Bolt lengths should be chosen so that the cylindrical portion of bolt is bearing on all members being joined. Bolts are designated as AN4-XX or AN4C-XX where XX defines grip length. Tighten all bolts to 70-75 lb-in. (8-9 N.m).

Fatigue strength of riveted joints and seams is increased by one part epoxy adhesive. This adhesive requires special material storage and metal preparation along with a low temperature heat cycle for curing. Because of its impracticality in field repairs, epoxy adhesive will not be used. Where possible, extra rivets and thicker metal gages should be used instead of adhesives. When making repairs, note epoxy exists and that parts may be difficult to separate, even after rivets are removed.

7.

### 10-66. Body Repair (Cont'D)

1. The damaged area should be thoroughly cleaned and inspected to determine cause and extent of damage. Body parts should be inspected for holes, cracks, dents, distortion, or breaks. Fasteners should be inspected for breaks, stretching, looseness, cocked heads, or hole elongation. Seams, flanges, and joints should be inspected for straightness or local deformation as an indication that fasteners may have been stretched or holes elongated. It is possible for this to happen and fasteners still appear to be tight in their holes. In addition, make thorough inspection of adjacent areas to determine if high loads have been transmitted from the damaged area to other areas. This can result in secondary damage in the form of distorted panels or seams, loosened or sheared fasteners, elongated fastener holes, and cracks.

2. Signs of rivet failure include tipped heads, looseness, and sometimes chipped or cracked paint. If heads are tipped in the same direction and rivets are loose in consecutive groups, the joint has undergone excessive load. Rivet heads which are tipped in different directions and are not in groups may be improperly installed. With chipped or cracked paint, it may be necessary to remove paint to check true condition of rivets. Rivets subjected to critical loads but showing no distortion, should be inspected if failure is suspected. The head should be drilled off, and the shank should be carefully punched out. Failure is indicated by notched rivet shank and misaligned holes. Flush rivets showing head slippage within the dimple or countersink indicate either sheet bearing or rivet shear failure and must be removed for inspection and replacement. If failure of rivets cannot be detected by visual inspection, the joint can be checked by drilling and punching out several rivets. If rivet shanks are notched, rivets should be replaced with next larger size rivets. If rivet holes show elongation due to local failure in tearing of the sheet, next larger size rivet must be used in replacement. Any deformation of the sheet around the rivet, tear outs, or cracks between rivets usually indicates partially failed or damaged rivets. Complete repair of the joint will require replacement by next larger size rivets. Use the next 1/32 inch larger diameter rivet to obtain a tight joint when original hole has been enlarged. If original size rivet is installed, the rivet would not be able to carry its share of the shear load, and the joint would not meet its strength requirement.

### C. Rivet Replacement Note

When removing rivets, care should be taken to not enlarge rivet hole as this would require use of an oversize or larger rivet for replacement.

### 1. Solid Rivet Removal.

(a)
File a flat surface on the manufactured head if accessible, It is always preferable to work on manufactured head rather than the one that is bucked over, since the former will always be more symmetrical about the shank.

Indent center of the filed surface with a center punch. Drill through rivet head. Be sure to use a drill slightly smaller than diameter of rivet shank to avoid making rivet hole oversized. Shear weakened rivet head off with a sharp chisel. For this operation, support back side of rivet and cut rivet head along direction of rivet line or panel edge. This will prevent distortion of the panel.

Firmly support the panel from the opposite side and drive out shank with a pin punch. If rivet is unduly tight because of swelling between sheets, drill rivet shank out with an undersize drill.

2. Blind Rivet Removal.

(b) (c)
(d)
(e)
(a) File a small flat on rivet head.

(b) Center punch the flat. Support rivet backside, if possible.

(c) Using a small drill about the size of rivet pin, drill off tapered end of pin which forms the lock.

## 10-66. Body Repair (Cont'D)

(d) Shear lock using a pin punch to drive out pin.

(e) Pry out remainder of locking collar.

(f) Using a drill slightly smaller than rivet shank, drill almost through rivet head.

(g) Pry off rivet head with a pin punch.

(h) Tap out rivet shank with a pin punch.

3. Rivnut/Plusnut Removal.

(a) Drill through rivnut head. (b) Punch out shank.

4. Rivet Hole Drilling.

(a) Center punch all new rivet locations. Center punch mark must be large enough to prevent drill from slipping out of position, yet it must not dent the surface of the material. To prevent denting, place a bucking bar behind material during punching.

(b) Make sure drill is the correct size (tables 10-1 and 10-2) and point is properly ground. A no. 10 drill is used to install standard 3/16-inch blind rivets.

5. Hole Countersinking.

Some rivet installations in the body require that rivet head be flush with the material surface. In these instances, countersunk or flush head rivets are used.

When using countersunk rivets, rivet holes must be countersunk with a tool having a 100" taper so rivet head will fit flush with surface.

When using a hand-operated countersink, the hole must be tried with a rivet so the recess will not be too deep or too shallow. It is best to use a countersink with a stop on it so depth of countersink can be controlled. Typical countersinking dimensions for blind rivets are shown in table 10-3. The minimum sheet thickness that can be machined for 100° countersink rivets is given in table 10-4.

Do not remove edge of hole on blind side of joint.

## 10-66. Body Repair (Cont'D)

6. Blind Rivet Driving Practices and Precautions.

(a) Rivets should be inspected for proper installation. The grip length of each rivet is marked on top of its head to provide positive identification. Use of proper grip length will produce a rivet installation where locking collar is flush with top surface of rivet head. Tolerance limit on flushness is 0.020 in. (0.5 mm).

(b) For proper rivet installation, it is imperative that holes be properly prepared, tools be in good working order, and rivets properly applied. When problems occur, the source of trouble could be in any of these areas.

7. Blind Rivet Installation.

- Prior to installing blind rivets, the hole must be prepared, the parts aligned and clamped firmly in place. These steps are the same as for solid riveting operations. Proper drill sizes for standard and oversized blind rivets are given in table 10-2.

Countersinking dimensions and minimum sheet gage for countersunk blind rivets are shown in tables 10-3 and 10-4.

. It is very important that the proper length rivet is selected for each application. Rivet lengths are sized by the range of material thickness that the rivet will grip. Selecting the proper rivet length is critical because rivets can tolerate only 1/16 inch variation in material thickness for each particular rivet length.

Rivet grip lengths are called out as a "dash number" at the end of the manufacturer's part number. Grip lengths are determined as shown in table 10-5.

- For double dimpled sheets, add countersunk head height to materials thickness.

- Use rivet installation tool kit for all blind rivets.
