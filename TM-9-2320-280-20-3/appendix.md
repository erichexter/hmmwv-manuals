# Appendix B Maintenance Allocation Chart

Section I. INTRODUCTION

## B-1. The Army Maintenance System (Mac)

a. This section provides a general explanation of all maintenance and repair functions authorized at various maintenance levels under the standard Army Maintenance System Concept.

b. The Maintenance Allocation Chart (MAC) in section II designates overall authority and responsibility for the performance of maintenance functions on the identified end item or component. The application of the maintenance functions to the end item or component will be consistent with the capacities and capabilities of the designated maintenance levels, which are shown on the MAC in column (4) as:
Unit - includes two subcolumns, C (operator/crew ) and O 
(unit) maintenance.

Direct Support - includes an F subcolumn. General Support - includes an H subcolumn. Depot - includes a D subcolumn.

c. Section III lists the tools and test equipment (both special tools and common tool sets) required for each maintenance function as referenced from section II.

d. Section IV contains supplemental instructions and explanatory notes for a particular maintenance function.

## B-2. Maintenance Functions

Maintenance functions will be limited to and defined as follows:
a. Inspect. To determine the serviceability of an item by comparing its physical, mechanical, and/or electrical characteristics with established standards through examination (e.g., by sight, sound, or feel).

b. Test. To verify serviceability by measuring the mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, or electrical characteristics of an item and comparing those characteristics with prescribed standards.

c. Service. Operations required periodically to keep an item in proper operating condition, i.e., to clean
(includes decontaminate, when required), to preserve, to drain, to paint, or to replenish fuel, lubricants, chemical fluids, or gases.

d. Adjust. To maintain or regulate, within prescribed limits, by bringing into proper or exact position, or by setting the operating characteristics to specified parameters.

e. Align. To adjust specified variable elements of an item to bring about optimum or desired performance.

f. Calibrate. To determine and cause corrections to be made or to be adjusted on instruments or test, measuring, and diagnostic equipment used in precision measurement. Consists of comparisons of two instruments, one of which is a certified standard of known accuracy, to detect and adjust any discrepancy in the accuracy of the instrument being compared.

g. Remove/Install. To remove and install the same item when required to perform service or other maintenance functions. Install may be the act of emplacing, seating, or fixing into position a spare, repair part, or module (component or assembly) in a manner to allow the proper functioning of an equipment or system.

h. Replace. To remove an unserviceable item and install a serviceable counterpart in its place.

"Replace" is authorized by the MAC and is shown as the 3d position code of the SMR code.

i. Repair. The application of maintenance services, including fault location/troubleshooting, removal/installation, and disassembly/assembly procedures, and maintenance actions to identify troubles and restore serviceability to an item by correcting specific damage, fault, malfunction, or failure in a part, subassembly, module (component or assembly), end item, or system.

j. Overhaul. That maintenance effort (service/action) prescribed to restore an item to a completely serviceable/operational condition as required by maintenance standards in appropriate technical publications (i.e., DMWR). Overhaul is normally the highest degree of maintenance performed by the Army. Overhaul does not normally return an item to like-new condition.

k. Rebuild. Consists of those services/actions necessary for the restoration of unserviceable equipment to a like-new condition in accordance with original manufacturing standards. Rebuild is the highest degree of materiel maintenance applied to Army equipment. The rebuild operation includes the act of returning to zero those age measurements (hours/ miles, etc.) considered in classifying Army equipment/components.

## B-3. Explanation Of Columns In The Mac, Section Ii

a. Column (1)-Group Number. Column 1 lists functional group code numbers, the purpose of which is to identify maintenance significant components, assemblies, subassemblies, and modules with the next higher assembly.

b. Column (2)-Component/Assembly. Column 2 contains the names of components, assemblies, subassemblies, and modules for which maintenance is authorized.

c. Column (3)-Maintenance Function. Column 3 lists the functions to be performed on the item listed in Column 2. (For detailed explanation of these functions, see para. B-2.)
d. Column (4)-Maintenance Category. Column 4 specifies, by the listing of a work time figure in the appropriate subcolumn(s), the category of maintenance authorized to perform the function listed in Column 3. This figure represents the active time required to perform that maintenance function at the indicated category of maintenance. If the number of complexity of the tasks within the listed maintenance function vary at different maintenance categories, appropriate work time figures will be shown for each category. The work time figure represents the average time required to restore an item (assembly, subassembly, component, module, end item, or system) to a serviceable condition under typical field operating conditions. This time includes preparation time (including any necessary disassembly/assembly time) troubleshooting/fault location time, and quality assurance/quality control time in addition to the time required to perform the specific tasks identified for the maintenance functions authorized in the maintenance allocation chart. The symbol designations for the various maintenance categories are as follows:
NOTE
When a complete replace or repair task performed at higher level maintenance includes lower level maintenance tasks (equipment condition/follow-on tasks), the lower level work time figures in the MAC must be added to the higher level work time shown in the MAC to determine the total time to accomplish that maintenance function.

NOTE
Do not try to tighten the seizing by twisting.

(3) Tighten the twist just enough to take up the slack. (4) Tighten the seizing by prying the twist away from the axis of the wire rope. (5) Tighten the twist again as described in step (3). (6) Repeat the process until the seizing can not be pryed away from the axis of the wire rope. (7) Cut off wire ends and pound the twist into contact with the seizing.

(b) Cut wire rope to length as shown and install part of clamp with nut on wire rope.

# Section Ii. Illustrated Manufacturing Instructions (Cont'D)

2. Position rope after seizing in a suitable fixture to make a loop, leaving enough rope to wrap around thimble and enclose in clamp.

3. Insert thimble and close jaws of fixture to enable rope to conform to groove of thimble. 4. Place one half of clamp in position and adjust rope accordingly. The seized portion of the wire rope should equal one rope diameter and protrude entirely beyond the threaded end of the clamp half.

5. Install clamp nut. Holding both threaded halves in position, push the nut into both halves through the first two threads. Ensure proper alignment of both threaded halves, and that there is no crossthreading.

6. Remove rope, clamp and thimble while still connected. 7. Hold opposing flats of clamp halves in suitable fixture and properly lubricate exposed threads with high-viscosity lubricating oil.

8. Using a permanent marker, mark one flat nut to ensure the same opposing flats are checked before and after tightening the clamp.

9. Using calipers, measure 1/8 inch across the flat nut from the bottom and note measurement.

10. Check to make sure clamp halves are properly secured in fixture, and tighten with appropriate wrench.

11. Using calipers, again take measurement of the same flat nuts as was done before tightening of the nut. If the increment dilation is between 0.004 and 0.007 inches, clamp is tight.

# Appendix E Torque Limits

#### E-1. General

This section provides general torque limits for screws used on the M998 series vehicles. Special torque limits are indicated in the maintenance procedures for applicable components. The general torque limits given in this appendix shall be used when specific torque limits are not indicated in the maintenance procedure.

Unless otherwise specified, standard torque tolerance shall be ± 10%. These general torque limits cannot be applied to screws that retain rubber components. The rubber components will be damaged before the correct torque limit is reached. If a special torque limit is not given in the maintenance instructions, tighten the screw or nut until it touches the metal bracket, then tighten it one more turn.

#### E-2. Torque Limits

Table E-1 lists dry torque limits. Dry torque limits are used on screws that do not have lubricants applied to the threads. Table E-2 lists wet torque limits. Wet torque limits are used on screws that have high pressure lubricants applied to the threads.

#### E-3. How To Use Torque Table

![1089_Image_0.png](images/1089_Image_0.Png)

a. Measure the diameter of the screw

![1089_image_2.png](images/1089_image_2.png)

you are installing.

b. Count the number of threads per inch.

c. Under the heading SIZE, look down the left-hand column until you find the diameter of the screw you are installing (there will usually be two lines beginning with the same size).

d. In the second column under SIZE, find the number of threads per inch that matches the number of threads you counted in step b.

CAPSCREW HEAD MARKINGS
Manufacturer's marks may vary.

These are all SAE Grade 5
(3-line).

e.

f.

To find the grade screw you are installing, match

![1089_image_1.png](images/1089_image_1.png) the markings on the head to the correct picture of CAPSCREW HEAD MARKINGS on the torque table.

Look down the column under the picture you found in step e. until you find the torque limit (in lb-ft or NŽm) for the diameter and threads per inch of the screw you are installing.

Corrected dial or scale readings are determined by the use of the following formula:

| Corrected   | Required     | Length of torque wrench + Length of adapter   |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| reading     | torque value | Length of Torque Wrench                       |

The length of the torque wrench is measured from the center of the handle to the center of the drive. The length of the adapter is measured from the center of the drive to the center of the winch.

Example:

| 1.14   |
|--------|

![1092_image_0.png](images/1092_image_0.png)

In this example, the torque wrench measures 22 in. (55.9 cm) and the adapter is 3 in. (7.6 cm). The required torque is 19 lb-ft (25.8 NŽm).

| 1.  (a) Properly seize wire rope end before cutting. To seize wire rope end, follow these instructions. |
| NOTE                                                                                                    |
| - Ensure each wrap is tight to the preceding wrap.                                                      |
| - Ensure the length of the seizing is not less than the diameter                                        |
| of the wire rope.                                                                                       |
| (1) Wrap the seizing wire around the wire rope as tight as possible.                                    |
| (2) Twist the ends of the seizing together by hand counterclockwise so that the twist is near the       |
| middle of the seizing.                                                                                  |
| NOTE                                                                                                    |
| Do not try to tighten the seizing by twisting.                                                          |
| (3) Tighten the twist just enough to take up the slack.                                                 |
| (4) Tighten the seizing by prying the twist away from the axis of the wire rope.                        |
| (5) Tighten the twist again as described in step (3).                                                   |
| (6) Repeat the process until the seizing can not be pryed away from the axis of the wire rope.          |
| (7) Cut off wire ends and pound the twist into contact with the seizing.                                |
| (b) Cut wire rope to length as shown and install part of clamp with nut on wire rope.                   |
