# Exhaust Gases Can Kill

Brain damage or death can result from heavy exposure. Precautions must be followed to ensure personnel safety when the personnel heater or engine of any vehicle is operated for any purpose.

1. Do not operate your vehicle engine in enclosed areas. 2. Do not idle vehicle engine with vehicle windows closed. 3. Be alert at all times for exhaust odors. 4. Be alert for exhaust poisoning symptoms. They are:
- Headache - Dizziness - Sleepiness - Loss of muscular control 5. If you see another person with exhaust poisoning symptoms:
- Remove person from area - Expose to open air - Keep person warm - Do not permit physical exercise - Administer artificial respiration, if necessary* - Notify a medic
* For artificial respiration, refer to FM 21-11.

6. BE AWARE, the field protective mask for nuclear, biological, or chemical (NBC) protection will not protect you from exhaust poisoning. THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST EXHAUST POISONING IS ADEQUATE VENTILATION.

# Warning Summary

- Improper cleaning methods and use of unauthorized cleaning solutions may cause injury to personnel or damage to equipment. See TM 9-247 for correct information.

- Compressed air used for cleaning purposes will not exceed 30 psi (207 kPa). Use only with effective chip guarding and personal protective equipment (goggles/shield, gloves, etc.).

- Do not touch hot exhaust system components with bare hands. Severe injury will result. - Gloves must be worn whenever handling winch cable. Severe injury may result. - Seatbelts are to be replaced as a set. Failure to do this may cause injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- Direct all personnel to stand clear during any hoisting operations. A heavy, swinging load can be extremely dangerous. Failure to do so may cause injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- Diesel fuel is highly flammable. Do not perform any procedure near fires, flames, or sparks. Severe injury or death may result.

- Ensure engine compartment is free of all tools and working material before starting engine. Failure to do this may cause injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- Do not remove surge tank filler cap before depressurizing system when engine temperature is above 190°F (88°C). Steam or hot coolant under pressure will cause severe burns.

- Do not drain oil when engine is hot. Severe injury to personnel will result. - Allow transmission/transfer case to cool before performing maintenance. Failure to do this may cause injury.

- When steam cleaning, protective clothing must be used. Failure to do this may cause injury. - Air pressure must not exceed 50 psi (345 kPa) when air checking forward and direct clutch piston or injury to personnel or damage to equipment may result.

- Direct all personnel to stand clear of vehicle before starting engine. Transmission slipping into gear may cause injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- When sanding fiberglass, personal protective equipment (respirator, goggles/shield, gloves, coveralls, etc.)
must be used. Failure to do this may cause injury.

- Do not operate heater in enclosed areas. Exhaust gases can kill. Make sure work area is well ventilated and exhaust fumes are routed away from test area.

- Drycleaning solvent is flammable and will not be used near an open flame. A fire extinguisher will be kept nearby when solvent is used. Use only in well-ventilated places. Failure to do this may result in injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- Always wear eye protection around R-134a or when servicing the air-conditioning system. Exercise extreme care when handling R-134a; direct contact between R-134a and skin may cause frostbite. Never smoke in areas where R-134a is used or stored. Ensure adequate ventilation whenever R-134a is being discharged. Personnel with a history of cardiac rhythm abnormalities should be made aware of potential aggravation as a result of exposure to R-134a. Failure to do so may result in injury to personnel.

- Air-conditioning system must be discharged prior to replacing components. Failure to do this may result in injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- Protective eye equipment (goggles/shield) must be worn when removing snaprings or springs. Failure to comply may result in injury to personnel.

- Ensure all slack from the three-point seatbelt or Improved Personal Restraint System is removed. The three-point seatbelt and Improved Personal Restraint System will lock only during sudden stops or impact. Injury and/or death to personnel may result if an accident occurs and seatbelts or lap and shoulder straps are not in use or adjusted properly.

- Vehicle armor is extremely heavy and must be supported during removal and installation. Failure to do so may result in injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

#### A. General

1. The body is constructed from aluminum alloys that have been heat-treated to obtain high strength.

Welding cannot be used to make body repairs. Heat generated in welding will reverse the heat treatment process and cause a great reduction in strength of material.

2. Solid 3/16-in. diameter aluminum rivets are the primary method of joining body components. Rivets are inserted into a hole through two pieces of metal, and a second head is formed by manual or pneumatic impact or by squeezing the rivet. A bucking bar is used to back up the rivet to form rivet head. When making repairs, use blind rivets of the same size or oversize diameter with the appropriate grip length.

3. Blind structural aluminum rivets of 3/16-in. diameter are used in applications where there is access from only one side of the part. Blind rivets are installed using a tool that pulls on the rivet stem, causing a bulbed head to form on the back side of the part. Fastening is complete when stem breaks off. High strength is obtained in blind structural rivets by mechanically locking the remaining stem inside rivet body. Blind pop rivets are used in locations where nonstructural attachments such as latches, striker plates, etc., are attached to the body.

4. Steel pull-type lockbolt fasteners in 3/16 and 1/4-in. diameter are used where tension or high shear loads exist. Lockbolts are two-piece unthreaded fasteners. One part is a high-strength, steel-headed, bolt-like part with serrations on its shank. The mating part is a collar which is swaged over the serrations, causing the fastener to be locked in place.

5. Rivnut/plusnut/nut insert fasteners are tubular rivets with internal threads. Rivnut/plusnut/nut insert fasteners are installed using a tool that engages the threads of the fastener and extends a pull, causing the shank to expand tightly against the material being fastened. This process is called "upsetting" a rivnut/plusnut/nut insert.

5.1. Struxnut fasteners are round, steel, with internal threads. Struxnut fasteners are installed using an automated or manual ramming device.

6. To facilitate repairs to body, it is acceptable to replace lockbolts and rivets with 1/4-in. AN4 series bolts. Do not replace lockbolts with rivets. Standard threaded fasteners should not be used, as these will quickly wear the aluminum structure. Bolt lengths should be chosen so that the cylindrical portion of bolt is bearing on all members being joined. Bolts are designated as AN4-XX or AN4C-XX where XX defines grip length. Tighten all bolts to 70-75 lb-in. (8-9 N•m).

7. Fatigue strength of riveted joints and seams is increased by one part epoxy adhesive. This adhesive requires special material storage and metal preparation along with a low-temperature heat cycle for curing. Because of its impracticality in field repairs, epoxy adhesive will not be used. Where possible, extra rivets and thicker metal gauges should be used instead of adhesives. When making repairs, note epoxy exists and that parts may be difficult to separate, even after rivets are removed.

#### 10-S. Body Repair (Cont'D)

b. inspection 1. The damaged area should be thoroughly cleaned and inspected to determine cause and extent of damage. Body parts should be inspected for holes, cracks, dents, distortion, or breaks. Fasteners should be inspected for breaks, stretching, looseness, cocked heads, or hole elongation. Seams, flanges, and joints should be inspected for straightness or local deformation which is an indication that fasteners may have been stretched or holes elongated. It is possible for this to happen and fasteners can still appear to be tight in their holes. In addition, make thorough inspection of adjacent areas to determine if high loads have been transmitted from the damaged area to other areas. This can result in secondary damage of distorted panels or seams, loosened or sheared fasteners, elongated fastener holes, and cracks. 

2. Signs of rivet failure include tipped heads, looseness, and sometimes chipped or cracked paint. If heads are tipped in the same direction and rivets are loose in consecutive groups, the joint has undergone excessive load. Rivet heads which are tipped in different directions and are not in groups may be improperly installed. With chipped or cracked paint, it may be necessary to remove paint to check true condition of rivets. Rivets subjected to critical loads but showing no distortion should be inspected if failure is suspected. The head should be drilled off, and the shank should be carefully punched out. Failure is indicated by notched rivet shank and misaligned holes. Flush rivets showing head slippage within the dimple or countersink indicate either sheet bearing or rivet shear failure and must be removed for inspection and replacement. If failure of rivets cannot be detected by visual inspection, the joint can be checked by drilling and punching out several rivets. If rivet shanks are notched, rivets should be replaced with next larger size rivets. If rivet holes show elongation due to local failure in tearing of the sheet, the next larger size rivet must be used in replacement. Any deformation of the sheet around the rivet, tear-outs, or cracks between rivets usually indicates partially failed or damaged rivets. Complete repairof the joint will require replacement by the next larger size rivets. Use the next l/32-in. larger diameter rivet to obtain a tight joint when original hole has been enlarged. If original size rivet is installed, the rivet will not be able to carry its share of the shear load, and the joint would not meet its strength requirement. 

#### C. Rivet Replacement Note

When removing rivets, do not enlarge rivet hole because this would require use of an oversize or larger rivet for replacement. 

1. Solid Rivet Removal. 

(a) 
(b) 
File a flat surface on the manufactured head if accessible. It is always preferable to work on manufactured head rather than the one that is bucked over, since the former will always be more symmetrical around the shank. 

Indent center of the filed surface with a center punch. 

Drill through rivet head. Be sure to use a drill slightly smaller than diameter of rivet shank to avoid making rivet hole oversized. 

Shear weakened rivet head off with a sharp chisel. For this operation, support back side of rivet and cut rivet head along direction of rivet line or panel edge. This will prevent distortion of the panel. 

Firmly support the panel from the opposite side and drive out shank with a pin punch. If rivet is unduly tight because of swelling between sheets, drill rivet shank out with an undersize drill. 

2. Blind Rivet Removal. 

(c) 
(d) 
(e) 
(a) File a small flat on rivet head. 

(b) Center-punch the flat. Support rivet backside, if possible. (c) Using a small drill about the size of rivet pin, drill off tapered end of pin which 'forms the lock. 

# 10-56. Body Repair (Cont'D)

(d) Shear lock using a pin punch to drive out pin. (e) Pry out remainder of locking collar. (f) Using a drill slightly smaller than rivet shank, drill almost through rivet head. (g) Pry off rivet head with a pin punch. (h) Tap out rivet shank with a pin punch.

3. Rivnut/Plusnut/Nut Insert Removal.

#### Warning

Drilling creates metal chips, which may enter eyes and cause serious injury. Eye protection is required.

(a) Drill through head of rivnut/plusnut/nut insert, using same size drill used to make original hole. Counterbore in rivnut/plusnut/nut insert will act as drill guide.

(b) Remove head of rivnut/plusnut/nut insert.

#### Caution

Do not puncture opposite face sheet of panel when punching out rivnut/plusnut/nut insert shank.

(c) Punch out shank of rivnut/plusnut/nut insert using a pin punch slightly smaller than hole in structure.

4. Rivet Hole Drilling.

(a) Center-punch all new rivet locations. Center punch mark must be large enough to prevent drill from slipping out of position, yet it must not dent the surface of the material. To prevent denting, place a bucking bar behind material during punching.

## 10-56. Body Repair (Cont'D)

(b) Make sure drill is the correct size (tables 10-1 and 10-2) and point is properly ground. A No. 10 drill is used to install standard 3/16-in. blind rivets.

(c) Place drill in center mark for new rivet locations, or align drill with old hole when replacing old rivets with oversize rivets. When using a power drill, give the bit a few turns with fingers before starting motor. This will help assure that drill does not jump out of position when motor is started.

NOTE
- While drilling, hold drill at 90° angle to material surface. Avoid letting drill wobble, marking oblong holes.

- Avoid excessive pressure. Let drill bit do the cutting. - Do not push drill through material.

(d) Remove all burrs with a metal countersink or file. (e) Clean away all drill chips. Care must be taken to assure no chips are trapped between sheets of metal. (f) Apply sealing compound to hole and surrounding area.

5. Hole Countersinking.

Some rivet installations in the body require that rivet head be flush with the material surface. In these instances, countersunk or flush-head rivets are used.

(a) When using countersunk rivets, rivet holes must be countersunk with a tool having a 100°
taper so rivet head will fit flush with surface.

(b) When using a hand-operated countersink, the hole must be tried with a rivet so the recess will not be too deep or too shallow. It is best to use a countersink with a stop on it so depth of countersink can be controlled. Typical countersinking dimensions for blind rivets are shown in table 10-3. The minimum sheet thickness that can be machined for 100° countersink rivets is given in table 10-4.

(c) Do not remove edge of hole on blind side of joint.

# 10-56. Body Repair (Cont'D)

6. Blind Rivet Driving Practices and Precautions.

(a) Rivets should be inspected for proper installation. The grip length of each rivet is marked on top of its head to provide positive identification. Use of proper grip length will produce a rivet installation where locking collar is flush with top surface of rivet head. Tolerance limit on flushness is 0.02 in. (0.5 mm).

(b) For proper rivet installation, it is imperative that holes be properly prepared, tools be in good working order, and rivets properly applied. When problems occur, the source of trouble could be in any of these areas.

7. Blind Rivet Installation.

- Prior to installing blind rivets, the hole must be prepared with the parts aligned and clamped firmly in place. These steps are the same as for solid riveting operations. Proper drill sizes for standard and oversized blind rivets are given in table 10-2. Countersinking dimensions and minimum sheet gauge for countersunk blind rivets are shown in tables 10-3 and 10-4.

- It is very important that the proper length rivet is selected for each application. Rivet lengths are sized by the range of material thickness that the rivet will grip. Selecting the proper rivet length is critical because rivets can tolerate only 1/16-in. variation in material thickness for each particular rivet length. Rivet grip lengths are called out as a dash number at the end of the manufacturer's part number. Grip lengths are determined as shown in table 10-5.

- For double-dimpled sheets, add countersunk head height to material thickness.

- Use rivet installation tool kit for all blind rivets.

e. Soft Top Canvas Repair

Since these procedures are a reinforcement guide, you can modify them to meet individual needs. These reinforcement procedures are helpful because: - The securing straps reinforce the enclosure and reduce its
"ballooning" action.

- The extra wear, damage, and holes in the enclosure are reduced.

- Any enclosure can be returned to a serviceable condition at a significantly lower cost than replacing the enclosure.

1. Secure six socket turnbuttons and grommets to canvas straps (2), (3), and (4) using twelve clinch plate turnbuttons, follow procedures found in FM 10-16, General Fabric Repair.

2. Sew the eight canvas straps (2), (3), and (4) to inside of soft top enclosure (1). Follow procedures for sewing on straps as found in FM 10-16, General Fabric Repair.

# Chapter 14 Troubleshooting (Ds/Gs) Section I. Mechanical Troubleshooting

## 14-1. General

Information in this section is for use by support maintenance personnel in conjunction with, and as a supplement to, troubleshooting procedures in chapter 2.

## 14-2. Mechanical Troubleshooting Instructions

a. The troubleshooting procedures in this section cannot give answers to every possible vehicle malfunction encountered. However, the procedures do list the most common answers to a problem in an organized step-bystep study. Faults are listed in the order they are most likely to occur, and instruction directs tests and inspections toward the source of a problem and successful correction.

#### Caution

Operation of a deadlined vehicle without preliminary inspection could cause further damage.

b. Do the easiest things first. Look for the most obvious cause to a problem. For example:
(1) Excessive oil consumption may be the result of leaks at gaskets or loose line connections. (2) Always check the easiest and most obvious things first. This simple rule saves time and trouble.

c. Doublecheck diagnosis before disassembly. The source of most engine problems can be traced to more than one part in a system. For example:
(1) Excessive fuel consumption may not be caused by the fuel pump alone. Instead, the trouble could be a clogged air cleaner or a restricted exhaust passage causing severe back pressure.

(2) Engines are often disassembled in search of a problem and the real evidence of the problem is destroyed. Check again to be sure an easier solution to the problem has not been overlooked.

d. Before correcting a problem, diagnose the cause of the problem. Do not allow the same failure to occur again.

d. Set air conditioner cooling and blower speed settings to maximum value (TM 9-2320-387-10).

e. Open vehicle doors to permit fresh flow of air through passenger compartment.

f. Run engine with air conditioner on for a minimum of five minutes to allow temperature and pressure stabilization.

## 14-6. System Performance Evaluation

a. Measure air temperature at outlet duct in crew compartment by inserting end of thermometer in center air duct louver. Normal operation air temperature at duct louver is 40°-50°F (4°-10°C), while ambient (air) temperature is 70°F (21°C) and humidity is low. Refer to table 14-2 for relative humidity effect on normal operation air temperature at duct louver.

In a properly functioning system, air temperature at duct will increase as the ambient air temperature and humidity increase.

b. Low and high side gauge readings on manifold gauge set are used to identify and diagnose system problems. Refer to table 14-2 for normal low and high side pressure readings.

c. After troubleshooting, repair, evacuation, and recharging are complete, conduct performance test of system. Refer to table 14-2 for performance guidelines.

d. Perform pressure gauge and in-vehicle cold air duct readings to confirm system has been restored to peak operating condition.

e. Verify refrigerant level is correct before returning vehicle to service.

## Air Conditioning (M1114) Troubleshooting Symptom Index

MALFUNCTION
TEST OR INSPECTION

## Air Conditioner

#### 1. Insufficient Cooling

a. Check for refrigerant loss.

Step 1. Connect manifold gauge set to service ports (para. 25-15). Step 2. Open all doors. Step 3. Start vehicle and allow vehicle engine to idle (TM 9-2320-387-10). Step 4. Engage system blower to high position (TM 9-2320-387-10). Step 5. Engage A/C system switch (TM 9-2320-387-10). Step 6. All A/C systems should be set to a maximum blower position 
(TM 9-2320-387-10).

Step 7. After five minutes, record the pressure readings and temperature of discharge air coming from unit outlets.

Step 8. Subtract air temperature from the ambient temperature of the surroundings. Step 9. Compare this temperature drop to the temperature drop as corrected for relative humidity (table 14-2).

A slow refrigerant leak is often indicated by a dirty, oily patch at or near the point of leakage. This is especially true along high pressure hoses and connections. A slight oily patch near the shaft nut of pulley and clutch assembly is normal seepage.

Step 10. Check low and high side gauges for low readings. If these conditions occur, perform leak test, repair leak, evacuate and recharge with R-134a (para. 25-15).

b. Check for air or moisture in system.

Step 1. Perform, steps 1 through 8 of malfunction 1a. Step 2. Check low side gauge for normal to high readings and thermometer for high reading.

Discharge system. Evacuate and recharge with R-134a (para. 25-15).

c. Check expansion valve(s).

Step 1. Perform steps 1 through 8 of malfunction 1a.

If control tube must be repositioned, rewrap bulb with insulating tape.

Step 2. If low side gauge is low or in vacuum and high side is normal to high with no cooling at louver, replace expansion valve (para. 25-26).

Step 3. If low side gauge is high and high side gauge is normal to low and thermometer reading is high, check bulb on expansion valve to ensure it is tightly clamped to suction tube on evaporator and wrapped. If this is ok, replace valve (para. 25-26).

d. Check thermostat.

Step 1. Perform steps 1 through 8 of malfunction 1a. Step 2. If all gauge readings are normal (table 14-2) and thermometer reading is normal to low and continues to fall, check thermostat probe. Ensure the probe is in the fins of the evaporator coil.

#### Table 14-3. Air Conditioning Troubleshooting (M1114) (Cont'D). Malfunction Test Or Inspection

Step 3. If the thermostat does not cycle off when discharge temperature of front unit drops to approximately 40°F, replace thermostat (para. 25-24).

Step 4. If thermostat cycles off but does not come back on for a long period, refer to step 3. Step 5. If clutch on compressor does not come on and evaporator temperature is above 40°F,
jump across thermostat. If this engages clutch, replace thermostat (para. 25-24).

e. Check for high side restriction.

Step 1. Perform steps 1 through 8 of malfunction 1a. Step 2. Check high side gauge for high reading and low side for normal to low reading. Monitor hoses and tubes for frost or ice.

Step 3. Check liquid hose/tube for temperature. The liquid hose/tube should be hot to the touch.

If not, check condenser for damage.

Step 4. If no frost or ice is noticed and low side gauge is normal to high or in a vacuum and replacing expansion valve did not fix system, replace suction hose.

- An ice or frost patch on hoses/tubes is a sign of restriction. Flush hose/tube or condenser. If this does not work, replace hose.

- Barrier hose has an internal barrier. It can collapse and cause a restriction.

f. Check condenser.

Step 1. Perform steps 1 through 8 of malfunction 1a. Step 2. Check low side of manifold gauge for normal or high reading and high side for high reading (table 14-2). If discharge (evaporator) air is warm, liquid line is hot, air flow through condenser is restricted, or bubbles are seen in sight glass, clean condenser exterior.

Step 3. If condenser fans are inoperative, check for system voltage at A/C circuit breaker.

If system voltage and A/C circuit breaker are good, check A/C power source circuit. Flush condenser (para. 25-15) or replace condenser (para. 25-18) if damaged.

g. Check for overcharged system.

Step 1. Perform steps 1 through 8 of malfunction 1a. Step 2. Check low side of manifold gauge for normal to high reading and high side for high reading (table 14-2). If system runs continuously, compressor is noisy on start-up, or discharge (evaporator) air is warm, then a partial system discharge is required; continue to step 3.

Step 3. Insert center hose of manifold gauge set in an empty bottle or can.

Do not allow refrigerant R-134a to escape too quickly. Refrigerant oil will escape.

Step 4. Turn low-pressure gauge valve and high-pressure gauge valve counterclockwise slightly to permit refrigerant to slowly escape through center hose until correct pressure is obtained.

#### 2. Intermitent Cooling

Check air conditioner output for temperature variation. If air is intermittently warm and cold, perform the following: 
Step 1. Check for air or moisture in system by performing malfunction lb. Step 2. Ensure temperature sensing probe is inserted properly in the evaporator fins near the outlet (para. 25-26). 

Step 3. Perform mechanical troubleshooting, malfunction 9. step 4. Check sight glass reading for oil streaks indicating too much oil in system. Step 5. If there is excess oil in system, flush A/C system (para. 25-15). Charge A/C system with correct quantity of refrigerant oil (para. 25-15). 

END OF TESTING! 

## Air Conditioner Compressor

Before beginning compressor troubleshooting or inspection procedures, always clean away oil, grease, dirt, and refrigerant residue. 

#### 3. **Insufficient Cooling**

a. If air conditioner compressor runs smoothly, perform the following: 
Step 1. 

Connect manifold gauge set to low and high service connector ports (para. 25-15). 

Step 2. 

Run compressor at idle speed (1,500 rpm) for five minutes. 

Step 3. 

If-unusually high low pressure is observed in combination with unusually low high side pressure, stop compressor and measure elapsed time before high side pressure is equal to low side pressure. If less than two minutes, then reed valve or head gasket may be defective. Replace compressor (para. 25-20). 

Step 4. 

If unusually low side pressure and high side pressure are observed, check for low refrigerant charge or refrigerant leaks and replenish refrigerant as necessary 
(para. 25-15). 

Check for compressor oil leak at front shaft seal in pulley and clutch assembly. Replace compressor if there is more than a minor dry patch (para. 25-20). 

Step 5. 

Step 6. 

Check compressor for oil leaks. If leaking at compressor hose junction, replace seals 
(para. 25-30). Any other compressor housing leaks require compressor replacement 
(para. 25-20). 

b. If air conditioner compressor runs intermittently or is inoperative, check clutch air gap (space between pulley and front clutch plate) with feeler gauge. Gap must-be within range of 0.016 - 
0.031 in. (0.406 - 0.787 mm). If gap is out of specification, replace compressor (para. 25-20). 

c. If compressor runs roughly, perform the following: 
Step 1. Discharge air conditioning system (para. 25-15). 

Step 2. Disconnect field coil harness connector from field coil. 

Step 3. Rotate compressor shaft clockwise (facing compressor) using 3/4-in. socket and wrench on shaft nut. 

Step 4. Check for severe rough spots or catches while rotating shaft nut. If rough spots or catches are observed, replace compressor (para. 25-20). 

END OF TESTING! 

#### Malfunction

TEST OR INSPECTION

#### 4. Unusual Noise With Clutch Engaged

a. Inspect compressor mounting component.

Step 1. Check for a loose belt. Step 2. Check for broken bracket or compressor mounting gear. Replace damaged components
(para. 25-20).

Step 3. Check for missing, broken, or loose bolts at compressor and engine mounting points.

Replace damaged or missing components (para. 25-20).

Step 4. Check for loose or wobbling compressor pulley and for shaft nut torque and bottoming.

Repair or replace damaged components (para. 25-20).

b. Inspect engine compartment.

Step 1. Disconnect serpentine belt (para. 3-81) and operate engine at idle to isolate engine noise from air conditioner compressor noise. If noise condition stops, continue to step 2. If noise condition still exists, refer to mechanical troubleshooting (table 2-1).

Step 2. Check for proper refrigerant charge (malfunction 1a). Low or excessive refrigerant charge can cause unusual noise.

Step 3. Check clutch air gap (space between pulley and front clutch plate) with feeler gauge. Gap must be within range of 0.016 - 0.031 in. (0.406 - 0.787 mm). If air gap is incorrect, replace compressor (para. 25-20).

c. Check clutch and pulley bearing operation.

Step 1. Remove serpentine belt (para. 3-81). Step 2. Rotate pulley by hand and listen for bearing noise while feeling for hard spots. If noise or hard spots are excessive, replace compressor (para. 25-20).

d. Check oil level.

Insufficient amount of oil may cause compressor to be noisy. Restore oil to correct level (para. 25-15).

END OF TESTING!

#### 5. Unusual Noise With Clutch Disengaged

a. Check clutch air gap (space between pulley and front clutch plate) with feeler gauge. Gap must be within range of 0.016 - 0.031 in. (0.406 - 0.787 mm). If air gap is out of specification, replace compressor (para. 25-20).

b. Check for defective clutch pulley. Replace compressor (para. 25-20).

END OF TESTING!

#### 6. Incorrect Oil Level Or Leak Note

There is no oil dipstick port on this A/C compressor. Oil quantity can only be checked in compressor by removing and draining the compressor.

After a system component has been replaced or there is reason to suspect an incorrect oil level or leak, check system (para. 25-20).

Repair or replace damaged components (para. 25-41).

b. Inspect engine compartment.

Step 1. Disconnect serpentine belt (para. 3-81.1 or para. 3-81.2) and operate engine at idle to isolate engine noise from air conditioner compressor noise. If noise condition stops, continue to step 2. If noise condition still exists, refer to mechanical troubleshooting (table 2-1).

Step 2. Check for proper refrigerant charge (malfunction 1a). Low or excessive refrigerant charge can cause unusual noise.

Step 3. Check clutch air gap (space between pulley and front clutch plate) with feeler gauge. Gap must be within range of 0.016 - 0.031 in. (0.406 - 0.787 mm). If air gap is incorrect, replace compressor (para. 25-41).

c. Check clutch and pulley bearing operation.

Step 1. Remove serpentine belt (para. 3-81.1 or para. 3-81.2). Step 2. Rotate pulley by hand and listen for bearing noise while feeling for hard spots. If noise or hard spots are excessive, replace compressor (para. 25-41).

d. Check oil level.

Insufficient amount of oil may cause compressor to be noisy. Restore oil to correct level (para. 25-50.1).

END OF TESTING!

#### 5. Unusual Noise With Clutch Disengaged

a. Check clutch air gap (space between pulley and front clutch plate) with feeler gauge. Gap must be within range of 0.016 - 0.031 in. (0.406 - 0.787 mm). If air gap is out of specification, replace compressor (para. 25-41).

b. Check for defective clutch pulley. Replace compressor (para. 25-41).

END OF TESTING!

#### 6. Incorrect Oil Level Or Leak Note

There is no oil dipstick port on this A/C compressor. Oil quantity can only be checked in compressor by removing and draining the compressor.

After a system component has been replaced or there is reason to suspect an incorrect oil level or leak check system.

d. Flushing System

#### Warning

Eye protection must be worn at all times when performing this procedure. Failure to do so may result in injury to personnel.

CAUTION
Never flush compressor. Damage to compressor will result if flushed. A/C system flushing is essential when replacing failed compressors. Failure to flush the system properly will result in damage to the new compressor.

- The procedures outlined below are to be followed whenever there is evidence of catastrophic compressor failure. Catastrophic compressor failure is defined as the failure of internal components located inside the compressor and is evident when the presence of sludge and/or metal particles is found mixed with the compressor oil.

- Do not attempt to use R-134a as a flushing agent. R-134a will not remain a liquid at ambient temperatures. Use a flushing solution that is specifically manufactured for use with R-134a for this procedure.

- Flushing is done to remove contaminants such as oil, sludge, and metal particles due to failed components.

- The following procedure should be completed with an EPA
approved Recovery Machine purchased locally.

1. Recover refrigerant in the A/C system by following the recommended recovery machine instructions.

(Refer to para. 25-15, task 25-15c).

2. Remove the A/C compressor. (Refer to para. 25-20). Drain the compressor oil into a clean container.

If the oil has evidence of contamination from metal particles or sludge, or the compressor has other evidence of catastrophic failure, proceed with the flushing instructions. If there is no evidence of oil contamination or catastrophic failure, proceed to A/C compressor replacement (Refer to para. 25-20).

3. Disconnect the discharge and suction lines from the compressor manifold (Refer to para. 25-20.1). 4. Remove the receiver/driers at the condenser and front evaporator locations (Refer to para. 25-16 and para. 25-17).

10. Insert the flushing gun nozzle (3) into the refrigerant outlet tube (4) of component to be flushed.

Continue flushing until there is no evidence of oil or contaminants. The flushing cylinder (2) may need to be refilled and pressurized depending on the amount of contamination.

11. Open the flushing gun valve (3) to blow flushing agent through component.

After flushing the component in one direction, reverse the connections of the drain hose and flushing gun. Repeat step 11 to ensure that the component has been flushed in both directions. If the drain hose does not fit over the hose fittings, the item being flushed will need to be oriented over a drain container to catch the solvent.

12. Prior to performing step 13, allow the flushing agent to stay in the component at least five minutes for cleaning action to occur.

13. Blow compressed air or nitrogen through the component until there is no evidence of flushing agent left inside the component.

#### Warning

Prior to removing the flushing agent cylinder hoses or flushing gun, relieve the pressure in the cylinder. Personal injury may occur.

14. Remove the flushing gun (3) and drain hose from component and cover refrigerant line with a clean shop rag.

15. Fill the new compressor with measured 12 ounces of PAG-150 refrigerant lubricating oil.

Failure to fill the compressor with the specified amount of oil will result in compressor or system component damage.

16. Reassemble the system using new front receiver dryer and rear receiver dehydrator, expansion valves, and new O-rings. new O-rings must be installed at each location that refrigerant lines were disconnected during the flushing procedure. Dip O-rings in refrigerant oil prior to assembly.

17. Recharge the system with refrigerant (Refer to para. 25-15.f). 18. Dispose of used flushing agent IAW local hazardous material disposal procedures.

g. Adding Refrigerant Oil

- It is not necessary to check or add oil as routine maintenance.

It is necessary to add oil when the evaporator, condenser, compressor, or receiver/dryer has been replaced or there was an obvious oil leak. When a system is discharged, it is also necessary to replace any oil carried out with the refrigerant.

- Vehicle must be on level ground. - A new compressor is charged with 6 oz of refrigerant oil.

1. If only the compressor is being replaced, drain and measure oil from compressor being replaced.

Drain new compressor and add the same amount of refrigerant oil as was drained from old compressor.

2. If there is a loss of refrigerant over a period of time and a component is being replaced to correct leak, add refrigerant oil to the component being replaced as follows: - Condenser - 1 oz - Receiver/Dryer - 1 oz - Evaporator - 3 oz 3. When the system oil level is unknown, or system performance and efficiency are marginal, drain and flush system and add a new 6-oz charge of refrigerant oil to the system.

c. Purge high-pressure hose (4) and low-pressure hose (6) at service ports on compressor. d. Turn high-pressure gauge valve (2) and low-pressure gauge valve (1) clockwise to OFF position.

5. Connect STE/ICE-R (para. 2-47) to obtain engine rpm reading.

#### Warning

Ensure high-pressure gauge valve is in closed position on manifold gauge set during charging. Failure to do so will cause compressor to build pressure in refrigerant container, causing injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

6. Start engine and set engine speed to 1,500 rpm with hand throttle (TM 9-2320-387-10). 7. Turn on A/C system (TM 9-2320-387-10) and set blower fans on high speed.

Keep refrigerant container upright at all times so refrigerant enters system as a gas.

8. Open low-pressure gauge valve (1) on manifold gauge set (3) until system is fully charged with 3 lbs 8 oz of R-134a refrigerant (refer to table 14-2).

9. Close low-pressure gauge valve (1) on manifold gauge set (3).

10. Return hand throttle to normal idle (TM 9-2320-387-10). 11. Stop engine (TM 9-2320-387-10). 12. Remove refrigerant R-134a source from center hose (5) of manifold gauge set (3). 13. If no refrigerant oil is needed, disconnect manifold gauge hoses (4) and (6) from A/C system service ports (9) and (10). Install caps (8) on service ports (9) and (10). If refrigerant oil is needed, perform task g.

![2150_Image_0.Png](2150_Image_0.Png)

g. Adding Refrigerant Oil

- It is not necessary to check or add oil as routine maintenance.

It is necessary to add oil when the evaporator, condenser, compressor, or receiver/dryer has been replaced or there was an obvious oil leak. When a system is discharged, it is also necessary to replace any oil carried out with the refrigerant.

- Vehicle must be on level ground. - A new compressor is charged with 6 oz of refrigerant oil.

1. If only the compressor is being replaced, drain and measure oil from compressor being replaced.

Drain new compressor and add the same amount of refrigerant oil as was drained from old compressor.

2. If there is a loss of refrigerant over a period of time and a component is being replaced to correct leak, add refrigerant oil to the component being replaced as follows: - Condenser - 1 oz - Receiver/Dryer - 1 oz - Evaporator - 3 oz 3. When the system oil level is unknown, or system performance and efficiency are marginal, drain and flush system and add a new 6-oz charge of refrigerant oil to the system.

FOLLOW-ON TASK: Lower and secure hood (TM 9-2320-387-10).

d. Assembly 

l For general assembly instructions, refer to para. 2-17. l Pinion gear depth is the distance from end face of pinion to center line of output shafts. The dimension is controlled by shims between pinion gear rear bearing cup and differential housing. The pinion gear is etched with two identifying numbers: the first number identifies ring gear and pinion gear as a matched set; the second number represents pinion depth variance and is preceded by a plus (+) or minus (-), which represents the amount in thousandths the gear set varied from the standard setting of 2.547 in. (6.47 cm). 

l If using original gear set, use original pinion depth shim as a starter shim and proceed to step 4. 

1. Measure thickness of original pinion depth shim (3) and record for reference. 

![2362_image_0.png](2362_image_0.png)

2. Check pinion depth variance numbers (2) marked on old and new pinion gears (1) and record for references. 

![2362_image_1.png](2362_image_1.png)

# 30-3. Differential Repair (Cont'D)

- If the old pinion is marked -3 and the new pinion is marked +2, the procedure would be as follows: Refer to Old Pinion Marking column at left side of table and locate -3. Then read to right, across table, until under +2 in New Pinion Marking column. Box where two columns intersect is amount of shim thickness change required. In this case, the number in the intersecting box is -0.005 in. (-0.13 mm), which represents the amount to be subtracted from the old shim thickness. If the box number had been a + figure, this amount would be added to the old shim thickness.

- This table determines an initial shim thickness. The actual pinion depth measurement must be performed and final shim thickness adjusted as necessary.

- Pinion shims are available from 0.084-0.111 in. (2.13-2.82 mm) in increments of 0.0005 in. (0.0127 mm).

3. Refer to Old and New Pinion Marking columns in table 30-1, Pinion Variance Table. Note on table where old and new pinion depth variances intersect to determine amount to be added or subtracted from original pinion depth shim for desired pinion depth starter shim.

11. 

Position arbor on block and install dial indicator on arbor post. Preload dial indicator until needle rotates approximately one full turn clockwise. Tighten dial indicator in this position and recheck. 

12.

Rotate gauge shaft slowly back and forth until dial indicator reads greatest deflection. At point of greatest deflection, set dial indicator to zero. Repeat rocking action of gauge shaft to verify gauge setting. 

13. 

After zero setting is obtained, rotate gauge shaft until dial indicator plunger does not touch block. 

14. 

Record dial indicator reading. Example: If the pointer moved counterclockwise and stopped between 0 and 11, add .lOO in. to measurement for shim thickness. If the pointer moved counterclockwise and stopped between 99 and 84, correct shim thickness is indicated. 

15. 

This reading indicates shim thickness that is required of a pinion that is etched with a zero (0) on pinion head. If pinion being installed has a plus (+) or minus (-1 etching, then an adjustment of shim thickness is required. Example: If a pinion is etched +3, then .003 in. less shim thickness is required. Subtract -003 in. from the indicator reading. If a pinion is etched -3, then -003 in. more shim thickness is required. Add .003 in. to the indicator reading. 

16. 

Remove dial indicator from arbor.

Remove four capscrews (31, two bearing caps (2), discs, and arbor from housing (1).

| General support     |

#### A. General Information

1. Frame rails are constructed by arc-welding two C-channels of preformed steel together to form a box-cross section.

2. Frame rails are internally reinforced at bolt hole locations by bushings or full cross-section spacers to prevent channels from collapsing from attaching load.

Crossmembers and crossmember brackets must be replaced if damaged.

3. The frame is made by bolting two non-identical frame rails to crossmembers. Crossmembers are held to more stringent dimensional tolerances and must be replaced if damaged.

4. The type of repairs attempted will vary considerably depending on equipment, type of facilities, and skill of available personnel. Also the choice of procedures will be influenced by parts supply status and the operational situation.

5. Mechanical forces involved in frame straightening can lead to safety problems, which all personnel must constantly consider.

6. The removal of frame constraints (loosening of crossmember and bracket fastenings) is critical to allow enough freedom of movement when straightening frame.

7. The objective of a repair procedure is to return the vehicle to a mission-safe (operationally and mechanically) condition within a reasonable time and cost expenditure.

8. For ease of frame maintenance, use powertrain lift sling. (Refer to task b.)

b. Powertrain Lift Sling Installation

#### Warning

- To avoid possible injury to personnel and damage to equipment, ensure shoulder bolts have a raised metal 10.9 material strength indicator on the head of the bolts.

- Rope lift slings are awkward and potentially hazardous to personnel and can cause damage to equipment. Replace rope lift sling with powertrain lift sling.

# 32-4. Frame Inspection And Repair (Cont'D)

c. Inspection 1. Visual inspection: This is the first and most critical step in deciding whether to repair or replace a damaged frame component. Factors to be noted in visual inspection: (a) Transverse tears, cracks, and breaks that extend over one tangent or radius and into 5/32 in.

(3.97 mm) of an associated tangent or radius must be replaced.

(b) Transverse tears, cracks, or breaks that extend over the tangent or radius can be repaired by welding and reinforcing, providing the crack does not extend into 5/32 in. (3.97 mm) of an associated tangent or radius.

(c) Tears, cracks, or breaks on the inside face of the frame rail that extend to within 3 in. (76.2 mm) of a bolted-on crossmember are unrepairable, and frame rail must be replaced.

(d) Tears, cracks, or breaks that extend into a hole or from a hole in the frame rails must first have a dye penetrant test performed at the hole to determine if secondary cracks exist (refer to TC 9-237). Secondary cracks are repairable. (See task c.1.)
(e) Tears, cracks, or breaks that extend into a hole or from a hole that does not have any existing secondary cracks may be repaired by welding with the use of a pre-drilled reinforcement (dutchman/fishplate) (refer to task e.).

(f) Short longitudinal cracks (up to 6 in. (15.2 cm)) or split welds can be repaired by installing a reinforcement (dutchman/fishplate) and heli-arc welding.

(g) Twisted frame rails are unrepairable; replace.

2. Measurements: Select a smooth, level surface with area 1-1/2 times the size of the vehicle.

(a) Vertical (or side view) measurement:
(1) Raise vehicle at four points until all four wheels are off the surface (para. 8-2).

#### Warning

Shim material must be under jackstand. Do not use shims on top of jackstand. Vehicle could be knocked off jackstand, causing personnel injury or damage to equipment.

(2) Measure height to bottom of frame near each jackstand. Place shim(s) under jackstands as necessary until all four heights are equal.

Measurements must be taken at identical locations on left and right frame rails. Failure to do so will result in faulty indication.

(3) Select, measure, and record frame rail height at several different positions on either frame rail.

(4) Measure and record frame rail height at corresponding points on opposite frame rail. (5) Right and left frame rail comparable points deviating more than 1/8 in. (3 mm) for each 2 ft 
(.6 m) linear distance indicate a vertically bent frame. Record deviations.

If measured frame rails are out of tolerance, notify supervisor. If frame rails are verified to be out of tolerance, vehicle will be classified as unserviceable.

(6) Lower vehicle from jackstands (para. 8-2).

#### 32-4. Frame Inspection And Repair (Cont'D)

(b) Horizontal (bowing) measurement. 

(1) 
(2) 
Select a smooth, level surface and drive vehicle into position from a 12 fi (3.7 m> straight line of travel. Apply parking brake gently to bring vehicle to a stop. Chock wheels (TM 9-2320387-10) and release parking brake. 

Measure height of frame rails (3) and (6) at each end near center of crossmembers (21 and (4). If heights vary by more than L/8-5/16 in. (3-B mm>, raise and install jackstands to bring frame to leveling tolerance &.ep 2a (11 and (21). 

Hold a string with plumb bob (71, as shown, along frame rail (61 at intersection of crossmember (2). Mark location (8) where plumb bob (7) stops moving. Repeat for other three comers of frame. 

(3) 

l Strings used for horizontal bow measurement will remain in place until procedure 2(c), frame skew, is completed. 

l "lb ensure measurements are precise, string must be pulled tight and secured. 

Stretch string tightly on ground (5) between front and rear plumb bob (71 marks under each frame rail (3) and (6). 

Measure front (2) and rearmost (4) crossmembers to determine center point. Drop a plumb bob (71 from these points to the ground. Mark location where plumb bob (7) stops moving. 

Stretch string tightly on ground (5) between front and rear plumb bob (7) marks under crossmembers (2) and (4) to determine centerline (1). 

(4) 
(5) 
(6) 
Measure an equal distance (D) along right and left strings to select your measure points and measure from these right and left points to center string. Mark these points on string. The distance from right and left points to center string should be within l/4 in. (6 mm) of being equal. If not, one frame rail is bowed. Repeat this procedure for several other points along frame. Record deviations. 

(7)

# 32-4. Frame Inspection And Repair (Cont'D)

(c) Diagonal (skew) measurement.

The following two steps are alternate procedures to determine if frame rails are skewed.

(1) Measure diagonally from one point on right or left string to adjacent point on opposite side string. Compare to the opposite diagonal measurement. If these two measurements differ by more than 1/4 in. (6 mm), the two frame rails are skewed. Repeat this procedure at other sets of four measuring points to confirm skew. Record deviations.

(2) Position a string across two plumb bob points at corresponding (or end) points of frame rail string. Place a square with one leg coincident with frame rail string. Run a line or string along other side of square as far as opposite frame rail string. Measure deviation of end string and square side line at opposite frame rail string. Any deviation means the two frame rails are skewed and, consequently, the crossmembers are not at square angles to frame rails. A deviation of 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) makes a vehicle dog track and it is difficult to align wheels. Record deviations.

If measured frame rails are out of tolerance, notify supervisor. If

![2390_image_0.png](2390_image_0.png) frame rails are verified to be out of tolerance, vehicle will be classified as unserviceable.

## 32-4. Frame Inspection And Repair (Cont'D)

(d) Decisions as to whether or not to repair frame will be made in accordance to the following factors: (1) Provisions of TB 750-98-23 regarding time and materials versus replacement. (2) Supply and operational considerations. (3) Appropriate facilities available. (4) Personnel skill levels. (5) Influence of other collateral repairs that may be required to return the vehicle to a serviceable condition.

(6) Buckled frame rails with both vertical and horizontal bending are extremely difficult to repair; item should be replaced.

(7) Twisted frame rails generally are unrepairable; replace item. (8) Frame rails that are bent upward, resulting in torn metal in bottom of rail, must be welded and have a welded-on fishplate repair. If fishplate would block mounting parts and bolt holes, replace frame rail.

#### C.1. Steering Gear Mounting Area Inspection Note

The inspection criteria is focused on the area surrounding the steering gear mounting tubes, commonly referred to below as bosses. They are located on the front left-hand frame rail. Tubes are welded in holes through the frame rail, accommodating the steering gear mounting bolts. Inside and outside frame rails in this area have experienced stress-cracking stemming from the steering gear mounting tubes. Stress cracks can be radial, tangential, transverse, and/or longitudinal, with some cases in the boss welds themselves.

1. Inspect steering gear mounting area as follows:
(a) Inspect all welds around bosses on inside and outside frame rails. Ensure boss welds are not undercut or undersized.

(b) Inspect surface between all bosses on inside, outside, top, and bottom of frame rails. (c) It may be necessary on suspect cracks to remove all paint. (d) Perform dye penetration test on any cracks found to locate ends of cracks and secondary cracks.

Cracks in boss welds are repairable. Secondary cracks are repairable, provided they meet criteria outlined is steps a and b.

2. Identify cracks in steering gear mounting area as follows:
(a) Tangential or radial cracks extending from/to any bosses and completely accessible are repairable if four inches long or less.

(b) Vertical and longitudinal cracks extending between any bosses are repairable if six inches long or less.

Frame rails are not repairable if they have secondary cracks that exceed the repair criteria, or cracks are present where the frame was previously repaired using a fish plate/support plate/repair plate.

(c) For any cracks found on top or bottom surface of frame rail, refer to task c.

1. To perform a repair on the frame, a plan is needed due to the large variability of steps and methods to be employed. This plan is influenced by: (a) Bending-type repair:
(1) Suitable vehicle restraints. (2) Solid anchors for pulling or seating snatch blocks. (3) Pulling (pushing) power source, either mechanical or hydraulic.

(b) Frame rail (and possibly one or more crossmembers) replacement requires a quantity of suitable blocking material.

(c) Patches, dutchman, fishplates, and reinforcements:
(1) Bulk steel plate of grade SAE 950 or equivalent (of equal or greater thickness). (2) Scrap material of like metal from salvage or cannabilization. (3) Heli-arc welding rods of type AWS A5.20 (E 707-1) or equivalent.

(d) In critical situations, 1/4-in. (6-mm) construction grade steel angle or plate may be used.

2. Based on factors of subtasks b and c, prepare a plan to return the vehicle to mission-serviceable status.

e. Repair Procedures

#### Caution

Bulk heating of frame rails to remove bends and buckles is not an approved procedure. The strength characteristics of the metal are affected. The repair may fail, causing damage to equipment.

The repair or replacement procedure will vary with type(s) and location(s) of failure(s). For this reason, much of the repair work depends on skill of the mechanics, supply status, and operational situation. The removal/replacement of parts, bolts, and brackets affecting the repair are left to the discretion of the mechanics and will be governed by the instructions in this manual and repair parts manual.

1. Transverse tears, cracks, and breaks repairs (all welding on frame) will use reinforcements
(dutchman/fishplate), and be heli-arc type as given in TC 9-237, providing tears, cracks, or breaks are repairable (refer to task c.). (a) Stop-drill crack with 1/8-in. (3-mm) drill hole. (b) Vee-notch crack. (c) Heli-arc weld crack with approved welding rod. (d) Grind-weld flush to the surface of the rail. (e) Install reinforcement (dutchman/fishplate) and lap-weld.

2. Welded reinforcements or fishplates will not be less than 6 in. (15.2 cm) in length along frame rail. 3. All puncture holes may be repaired as follows:
(a) Heli-arc weld fill holes. (b) Grind-weld flush to surface. (c) Install reinforcement (dutchman/fishplate) and lap-weld.

4. Bending repair:

#### Warning

When performing frame rail straightening repairs accomplished with power-driven mechanical or hydraulic means, all personnel will stand clear of vehicle. Failure or malfunction of equipment may cause injury to personnel.

(a) Do not attempt to repair a bend when:
(1) Buckling to a height of 1/4 in. (6 mm) on any one face of frame box is involved. If more than one face of frame box is involved with bending, replace part.

(2) Bending also includes more than very minor twisting. (3) Part is bent in two directions, replace part. (4) Bending involves a collapse of one or more faces of frame box at a suspension or body attachment point, replace part.

(b) When performing straightening repair with frame on vehicle:
(1) Use spreader plates or wood blocking to distribute chain force to avoid damage to frame box section.

(2) Be sure to loosen sufficient length of frame to allow frame force points to move without causing other damage.

(3) Restrain vehicle movement in both directions along line of force application.

(c) Vertical bends, except at end sections, require removal of frame rail or crossmember from vehicle. Straightening is done by using before and after dimensional measurements.

(d) Application of bulk heating to frame components is not authorized; metal properties are irreversibly degraded.

(e) At the conclusion of a bend repair, carefully inspect welds in vicinity of repair and area of force application. Any evidence of cracking or chipping of welds must be repaired. (Refer to step 1.)
(f) Spot-paint repaired areas using Chemical Agent Resistant Coating (CARC), following TM 43-0139, Painting Instructions for Field Use.

5. Front and rear wheel alignment checks (paras. 8-9 and 8-10) will be made after all frame repairs are completed.

#### 33-5. General

a. The body is constructed of aluminum alloys that have been heat-treated to obtain high strength. 

Welding cannot be used to make body repairs. Heat generated in welding will reverse the heat treatment process and cause a great reduction in strength of material. 

b. The hood and engine access cover are made of fiberglass (sheet molding compound). Cracks, splits, or holes may be repaired with a glass reinforced plastic laminate repair kit, MIL-R-19907C. (Refer to para. 33-9.) 
c. Solid 3/16-m. diameter aluminum rivets are the primary method of joining body components. The rivet is inserted into a hole through two pieces of metal, and a second head is formed by manual or pneumatic impacting or by squeezing the rivet. A bucking bar is used to back up the rivet to form the rivet head. When making repairs, use blind rivets of the same size or oversize diameter with the appropriate grip length. Rivets 3/16-in. in diameter are identified in appendix F, table F-l. For other rivets that may be needed, the NSN for the rivet can be determined by cross-referencing the rivet part number to an NSN. To determine the proper rivet part number, the following part number breakdown is provided: 
MS20600 -basic MS number AD - indicates aluminum 6 - indicates rivet sleeve diameter in Y3Zin. increments (6 x l/32 = 6/32 = 3/16-in.) 
W - indicates serrated stem rivet 2 - indicates maximum grip length in 1/16-in. increments (2 x 1/16 = 2/16 = Y8-in.) 
d. Blind structural aluminum rivets of 3/16-in. diameter are used in applications where there is access from only one side of the part. Blind rivets are installed using a tool that pulls on the rivet stem causing a bulbed head to form on the back side of the part. Fastening is complete when stem breaks off. High strength is obtained in blind structural rivets by mechanically locking the remaining stem inside rivet body. 

e. Steel pull-type lockbolt fasteners of 3/16-in. and l/Pin. diameter are used where tension or high-shear loads exist. Lockbolts are two-piece unthreaded fasteners. One part is a high-strength, steel-headed, bolt-like part with serrations on its shank. The mating part is a collar which is swaged over the sex-rations causing the fastener to be locked in place. 

f. To facilitate repairs to the body, it is acceptable to replace lockbolts and rivets with 3/16-in. AN3 series and Y4in. AN4 series bolts. Do not replace lockbolts with rivets. Standard threaded fasteners should not be used as these will quickly wear the aluminum structure. Bolt lengths should be chosen so that the cylindrical portion of the bolt is bearing on all members being joined. AN3 and AN4 series bolts are identified in appendix F, table F-3. Tighten all bolts to 70-75 lb-in. (8-8.5 N-m). 

g. Fatigue strength of riveted joints and seams is increased by applying one part epoxy adhesive. This adhesive requires special material storage and metal preparation along with a low-temperature heat cycle for curing. Because of its impracticality in field repairs, epoxy adhesive will not be used. Where possible, extra rivets and thicker metal gauges should be used instead of adhesives. When making repairs, note epoxy applications. Parts may be difficult to separate, even after rivets are removed. 

#### 33-6. Inspection

a. General. The damaged area should be thoroughly cleaned and inspected to determine cause and extent of damage. Body parts should be inspected for holes, cracks, dents, distortion, or breaks. Fasteners should be inspected for breaks, stretching, looseness, cocked heads, or hole elongation. Seams, flanges, and joints should be inspected for straightness or local deformation as an indication that fasteners may have been stretched or holes elongated. It is possible for this to happen and fasteners still appear to be tight in their holes. In addition, make a thorough inspection of adjacent areas to determine if high loads have been transmitted from the damaged area to other areas. This can result in secondary damage in the form of distorted panels or seams, loosened or sheared fasteners, elongated fastener holes, and cracks. 

b. Classification. ARer extent of damage has been determined, affected parts should be classified into one of the following categories: 
l Negligible damage 

l Damage repairable by patching l Damage repairable by insertion l Damage necessitating replacement of parts

## 1 33-6. Inspection (Cont'D) 1

1. Negligible damage: Minor dents, nicks, scores, cracks, and holes in body panels which are within or are brought within reasonable limits by a simple procedure, without extensive rework, are considered negligible damage. These defects should be considered more serious if located in main structural members such as body side rails, A-pillars, or floor crossmembers rather than in body panels such as cowls or rear wheelhouses. Deep wrinkles of undetermined origin in body panels should not be classed as negligible until the source of wrinkles has been investigated and positively identified. Damage other than small dents, holes, nicks, and scratches will require repair or replacement of the part. Refer to para. 33-8-f for repair of negligible damage. 

(a) Negligible cracks. Isolated cracks less than 0.50 in. (1.27 cm) long may be classified as negligible cracks provided they are stop-drilled at each end to stop propagation. 

(b) Negligible holes. Isolated holes no more than 0.50 in. (1.27 cm) diameter, after they are made round with smooth edges are classified as negligible holes, provided the distance from the edge of the hole to the nearest line of rivets exceeds the diameter of the hole. 

(c) Negligible dents and distortion. Small dents and distorted areas may be classed as negligible if they can be repaired by hammering or bending without causing the material to crack. Heat may not be used for reforming. 

2. Damage repairable by patching: Damage beyond negligible must be repaired, or the section replaced. 

Patches can often be applied over damaged body panels provided damaged area is first trimmed to remove sharp edges or notches which could cause the start of new cracks. The patch must then be sized to overlap the area to allow for attaching rivets. Refer to para. 33.8.g for repair by patching. 

3. Damage repairable by insertion: In certain cases, patch repairs may not be desirable because of impracticality or because a flush surface is desired. In this case, damaged area must be cut away and a partial replacement of equivalent material inserted flush with adjacent areas and backed up with a doubler. 

Refer to para. 33-8.h for repair by insertion. 

4. Damage necessitating replacement of parts: Parts too badly damaged for repair, or where replacement is easier than repair, fall into this category. Repair of welded assemblies such as body mounts are also in this category. Welded assemblies cannot be re-welded without destroying strength of the part and must be replaced. 

c. Rivet Failure. Signs of rivet failure include tipped heads, looseness, and sometimes chipped or cracked paint. If heads are tipped in the same direction and rivets are loose in consecutive groups, the joint has undergone excessive load. Rivet heads which are tipped in different directions, and are not in groups may be improperly installed. With chipped or cracked paint, it may be necessary to remove paint to check true condition of rivets. Rivets subjected to critical loads but showing no distortion should be inspected if failure is suspected. The head should be drilled off, and the shank should be carefully punched out. Failure is indicated by notched rivet shank and misaligned holes. Flush rivets showing head slippage within the dimple or countersink indicate either sheet bearing or rivet shear failure and must be removed for inspection and replacement. If failure of rivets cannot be detected by visual inspection, the joint can be checked by drilling and punching out several rivets. If rivet shanks are notched, rivets should be replaced with next larger size rivets. If rivet holes show elongation due to local failure in tearing of the sheet, next larger size rivet must be used in replacement. Any deformation of the sheet around the rivet, tear-outs, or cracks between rivets usually indicates partially failed or damaged rivets. Complete repair of the joint will require replacement by next larger size rivets. Use the next .031 in. (0.79 mm) larger diameter rivet to obtain a tight joint when original hole has been enlarged. If original size rivet is installed, the rivet would not be able to carry its share of the shear load, and the joint would not meet its strength requirements. 

d. Lockbolt Failure. Lockbolts are used to withstand tension loads and high-shear loads. These fasteners are installed in their holes with an interference fit. No looseness can be permitted. Lockbolts showing evidence of being stretched, broken, loose in their holes, or having heads that do not set flat against the surface must be replaced. Guidelines used in 33-6.~ for detecting rivet failures also apply to lockbolts. 

When removing rivets, care should be taken to not enlarge rivet hole as this would require use of an oversize or larger rivet for replacement. 

#### A. **Solid** Rivet **Removal**

1. File a flat surface on the manufactured head if accessible. It is always preferable to work on manufactured head rather than the one that is bucked over, since the former will always be more symmetrical about the shank 2. Indent center of the filed surface with a center punch 3. .Drill through rivet head Be sure to use a drill slightly smaller than diameter of rivet shank to avoid making rivet hole oversized. 

4. Shear weakened rivet head off with a sharp chisel. For this operation, support back side of rivet and cut rivet head along direction of rivet line or panel edge. This will prevent distortion of the panel. 

5. Firmly support the panel from the opposite side and drive out shank with a pin punch. If rivet is unduly tight because of swelling between sheets, drill rivet shank out with an undersize drill bit. 

#### B. Blind Rivet **Removal.**

1. **File** a small flat space on rivet head. 

2. Center punch the flat space. Support rivet backside, if possible. 

3. Using a small drill bit about the size of rivet pin, drill off tapered end of pin which forms the lock. 4. Shear lock using a pin punch to drive out pin. 5. Fry out remainder of locking collar. 

6. Using a drill bit slightly smaller than rivet shank, drill almost through rivet head 7. F'ry off rivet head with a pin punch_ 
8. Tap out rivet shank with a pin punch

c. Lockbolt RemovaL 
1. Work from the head side of lockbolt, if accessible. File a small tlat space on the head if rounded. 2. Center punch the head 3. Using a hardened drill bit slightly smaller than lockbolt, drill through the head In cases where lockbolts are too hard to be drilled with available drills, grind the head down using a cutoff wheel or carbide bit in a die grinder. When using grinder method, cut the head down until it is very thin, but do not grind it completely off or touch the body part with grinding tool. 

4. Use a pin punch to pry off head or shear it off with a sharp chisel. Make sure the part is adequately supported while performing this step. 

5. Drive lockbolt out of its hole with a pin punch Care must be taken so that hole or part is not distorted. 

In cases where lockbolt head is inaccessible, the locking collar must be removed. It is best to remove collars by grinding or by splitting them axially with a sharp chisel. 

## 1 33-7. Rivet Replacement (Cont'D) 1

#### D. Rivet Hole Drilling.

1. Center punch all new rivet locations. Center punch mark must be large enough to prevent drill bit from slipping out of position, yet it must not dent the surface of the material. 'lb prevent denting, place a bucking bar behind material during punching. 

2. Make sure drill bit is the correct size (tables 33-1 and 33-2) and point is properly ground. A no. 10 drill bit is used to install standard 3/16-in. blind rivets.

3. Place drill bit in center mark for new rivet locations, or align drill bit with old hole when replacing old rivets with oversize rivets. When using a power drill, give the bit a few turns with fingers before starting motor. This will help assure that drill does not jump out of position when motor is started. 

l While drilling, hold drill at 90" angle to material surface. Avoid letting drill wobble, making oblong holes. 

l Avoid excessive pressure. Let drill bit do the cutting. l Do not push drill through material. 

4. Remove all burrs with a metal countersink or file. 

5. Clean away all drill chips. Care must be taken to assure that no chips are trap@ between sheets of metal. 

6. Apply sealing compound (appendix C, item 61) to hole and surrounding area.

#### E. Hole **Countersinking.** Note

Some rivet installations in the body require that rivet head be flush with the material surface. In these instances, countersunk or flush-head rivets are used. 

1. When using countersunk rivets, rivet holes must be countersunk with a tool having a 100" taper so rivet head will fit flush with surface. 

2. When using a hand-operated countersink, the hole must be tried with a rivet so the recess will not be too deep or too shallow. It is best to use a countersink with a stop on it so depth of countersink can be controlled. Typical countersinking dimensions for blind rivets are shown in table 33-3. The minimum sheet thickness that can be machined for 100" countersink rivets is given in table 33-4. 

3. Do not remove edge of hole on blind side of joint.

#### F. Blind Rivet Driving Practices And Precautions.

1. Rivets should be inspected for proper installation. The grip length of each rivet is marked on top of its head to provide positive identification. Use of proper grip length will produce a rivet installation where locking collar is flush with top surface of rivet head. Tolerance limit on flushness is 0.020 in. (0.5 mm). 

2. For proper rivet installation, it is imperative that holes be properly prepared, tools be in good working order, and rivets properly applied. When problems occur, the source of trouble could be in any of these areas. 

## 33-7. Rivet Replacement (Cont'D)

#### G. Blind Rivet Installation. Note

l Prior to installing blind rivets, the hole must be prepared, and the parts aligned and clamped firmly in place. These steps are the same as for solid riveting operations (refer to para. 33-5.d). Proper drill sizes for standard and oversized blind rivets are given in table 33-2. Countersinking dimensions and minimum sheet gauge for countersunk blind rivets are shown in tables 33-3 and 33-4. 

l It is very important that the proper length rivet is selected for each application. Rivet lengths are sized by the range of material thickness that the rivet will grip. Selecting the proper rivet length is critical because rivets can tolerate only l/16%. variation in material thickness for each particular rivet length Rivet grip lengths are called out as a dash number at the end of the manufacturer's part number. Grip lengths are determined as shown in appendix F, table F-1. 

l For double-dimpled sheets, add countersunk head height to material thickness. 

l Use rivet installation tool kit, D-lOO-ML1, and puller head adapters, if required, for all blind rivets.

Insert rivet stem into pulling head of rivet gun or adapter. 

1. 

Hold rivet gun in line with axis of rivet as accurately as possible. 

2. 

Apply a steady, firm pressure against rivet head. 

Squeeze handles of manual gun. The rivet clamping action will pull sheets together, seat rivet head, and break stem flush with head of rivet.

## 33-8. Aluminum Repair

#### Caution

Repairs should not be made on the body using welding or heat for forming. Heat will only weaken material and cause further problems. 

a Mate&L Aluminum material used for repair should be of the same alloy and temper as original, if possible. In general, 6061-T6 aluminum alloy should be used. Material thickness must be the same or thicker. This alloy will work well for flat repairs, but is not well suited to bending because it is quite hard and cracks easily when bent sharply. When bends must be made, use softer 6061-T4 aluminum alloy and increase material thickness by at least 50 percent. As a general rule of thumb, 6061-T4 alloy should be bent with a minimum bend radius of one to two times material thickness, whereas 6061-T6 alloy requires at least three times material thickness radius for bends. In all cases, bends should be closely inspected for cracks. A 
suitable method for avoiding cracks during bending is to obtain angles that are extruded from 6061-T6 alloy or use preformed angles for repairs. Bulk aluminum is identified in appendix F, table F-2. 

b. Epoxy Adhesive. Where it is necessary to remove parts, note that epoxy adhesive is used in joints. 

Use care in parts removal to avoid unnecessary distortion. Parts should be separated by peeling them apart using a knife or chisel to start the peeling action. Before parts are reassembled, it will be necessary to remove any remaining cured epoxy from joints so parts will fit together with good, even contact. Use of epoxy requires special storage and application procedures which do not lend themselves to field repairs. For this reason, epoxy will not be used for repair. To compensate for the lack of epoxy, additional rivets should be used when making repairs to existing joints. 

## 1. Aluminum Repair (Cont'D) 1

#### C. Rivet Patterns.

1. Rivet patterns are denoted by rivet spacing and rivet edge distance. Rivet edge distance is the distance from center of rivet to nearest edge of sheet. Rivet spacing is defined as the distance from center of rivet to center of adjacent rivet. 

2. Required rivet spacing is determined by strength needed in the joint. A general feel for strength required can be obtained by inspecting rivet patterns in surrounding areas. Body repairs made using single rows of rivets should be performed using rivet spacing not greater than **1.5 in. (3.8 cm) and** not less than 0.625 in. (15.9 mm). Use 1 in. rivet spacing as a general practice for repairs. Rivet spacing used in original construction may be greater due to additional strength obtained by using epoxy adhesive. Do not use rivet edge distances less than 0.375 in. (9.5 mm). 

3. High-strength joints or large area patches may require use of double or multiple rows of rivets to obtain sufficient strength. 

![2410_image_0.png](2410_image_0.png)

DOUBLE ROW RIVETING PATTERN 

![2410_image_1.png](2410_image_1.png)

TRIPLE OR MULTIPLE ROW RIVETING PATTERN 

## 33-8. Aluminum Repair (Co&D)

4. Care must be taken to assure rivet hole patterns are transferred accurately in the case where a part with no holes is mated to one which already has rivet holes. Hole patterns may be transferred using one of the following methods: 
(a) Lay new part in place and use holes in mating part as a drill template. This requires that the new part be underneath the mating part. Care must be taken not to distort original holes. 

(b) Use removed part as a drill template by clamping the old and new parts together. This requires that the parts nest flat and rivet flange be undistorted. 

#### 13. **Joint Designs.**

1. Loads are applied through a joint to fasteners that hold it together. These loads are applied to fasteners in the form of shear loads or tension loads. If load is perpendicular to axis of fasteners, the fastener is loaded in shear. The fastener is loaded in tension when load is along axis of fastener, causing a pull on each end of fastener. 

2. Rivets (1) are designed to be loaded in shear. Do not create any new joints during repairs which 

![2411_image_1.png](2411_image_1.png)

cause rivets to be used in a tension application. Bolts (2) should be used for tension applications or substituted for rivets in very high-shear load applications.

## 1 33-8. Aluminum Repair (Cont'D) 1

#### E. Repair Parts **Preparation.**

1. Repair parts or patches should be painted with epoxy primer before installation. 

2. Apply sealing compound (appendix C, item 611 to mating surfaces to prevent corrosion. 

3. Install insertion or patch as detailed in 33-8g and 33-8h. 4. Paint repaired area with epoxy primer. 5. Paint repaired area with polyurethane as required.

#### F. Repair Of Negligible **Damage.**

1. Negligible cracks as defined in para. 33-613 are repaired by drilling a small hole at each end of crack to stop crack propagation. This is called stop-drilling. Table 33-5 gives proper drill sizes for stop-drilling cracks. 

2. Negligible holes are repaired by rounding and smoothing edges of hole to alleviate stress risers caused by sharp notches. 

#### Caution

Heat will never be used to re-form parts because it greatly reduces 

#### Part Strength.

3. Small dents and distorted areas may be repaired by bending or hammering, as long as the operation does not cause materials to crack or tear. Sharp bends should not be attempted.

g. Repair by Patching. Most body panel damage that exceeds the limits of negligible damage may be repaired by patching. This procedure involves removal of damaged area (1) and application of a patch (2) to cover the area (1). The damaged area is prepared by removal of the damage followed by rounding or smoothing of all corners and edges. This helps to assure that cracks will not spread into undamaged areas. In the case of a large crack (4), it may be desirable to stop-drill the crack (4) rather than cut out a portion of the panel (5) or structural member. Repair is completed by applying a large overlapping patch (3) over the area that was damaged. The overlap must be sufficient to allow the observance of proper rivet edge distance (6) 
(para. 33-8c). Large areas of damage are best repaired using a patch that is attached with multiple rows of rivets (para. 33-8c).

## 33-8. Aluminum Repair (Cont'D)

h.  Repair by Insertion.  For damage that is larger or more severe than a crack or hole, it is often desirable to remove damaged area (1), insert a piece of material (3) into removed area and reinforce this with a doubler (2). This is termed repair by insertion. This method or repair is typically stronger and stiffer than an added patch.

#### 33-9. Fiberglass Repair

a. General. The hood and engine access cover are made of fiberglass (sheet molding compound). Cracks, splits, or holes may be repaired with a glass-reinforced plastic laminate repair kit, ML-R-19907C, NSN 2090-00-372-6064. 

b. Inspection. 

Hood surface has a thin layer of gel coat that may appear cracked in a spider-web-like pattern due to hood flexing. No repair is required. 

1. Examine cracks to determine if they are on the surface only, or are deep breaks into material thickness. 

2. If filler material chips off at bonding flanges, appearing as cracked but not broken through, area need not be repaired. 

3. If a total penetration crack greater than one inch exists in critical areas: such as hinges (31, latches (21, or hood stop (1) areas, repair immediately. 

4.

- Caster and camber adjustments are basically the same for all four wheels. This procedure covers the right front wheel.

- Maxmimum side to side difference is 1°.

1. Remove wheel (para. 8-3). 2. Remove two locknuts (7), washers (2), capscrews (1), and washers (2) from upper control arm (8) 
and mounting brackets (3). Discard locknuts (7).

3. Loosen two capscrews (6) and four nuts (5) on two mounting brackets (3) and airlift brackets (4).

NOTE
- When adjusting front and rear suspension camber, add or subtract shims as matched sets under both upper control arm mounting brackets.

- Shims are available in 0.060-in. (1.52-mm) and 0.120-in. 

(3.05-mm) thicknesses.

4. Add or subtract shim(s) (9) as required to bring caster and/or camber within specifications 
(table 34-1). Suspension alignment change in relation to shim selection is shown in table 34-2.

#### Table 34-2. Suspension Alignment Change. Note

| DRILL TWENTY\-FOUR 0.187\-IN. (4.75\-MM)   | DIAMETER HOLES   |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------|

- Subtracting shims will affect caster/camber in the opposite direction as compared to adding shims.

- For 0.06 in. (1.52 mm) shims, reduce the values in the table by half.

- For larger changes, combinations of additions or subtractions will provide desired results.

# Appendix B Maintenance Allocation Chart

Section I. INTRODUCTION

## B-1. The Army Maintenance System (Mac)

a. This introduction provides a general explanation of all maintenance and repair functions authorized at the two maintenance levels under the Two-Level Maintenance System Concept.

b. This MAC designates overall authority and responsibility for the performance of maintenance functions on the identified end item or component. The application of the maintenance functions to the end item or component levels, which are shown on the MAC in column (4) as:
Field - includes two columns, Unit maintenance and Direct Support maintenance. The Unit maintenance column is divided again into two more subcolumns, C for Operator or Crew and O for Unit maintenance. Sustainment - includes two subcolumns, general support (H) and depot (D).

c. The tools and test equipment requirements list the tools and test equipment (both special tools and common tool sets) required for each maintenance function as referenced from the MAC.

d. The remarks contain supplemental instructions and explanatory notes for a particular maintenance function.

## B-2. Maintenance Functions

Maintenance functions are limited to and defined as follows:
a. Inspect. To determine the serviceability of an item by comparing its physical, mechanical, and/or electrical characteristics with established standards through examination (e.g., by sight, sound, or feel). This includes scheduled inspection and gagings and evaluation of cannon tubes.

b. Test. To verify serviceability by measuring the mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, or electrical characteristics of an item and comparing those characteristics with prescribed standards on a scheduled basis, i.e., load testing of lift devices and hydrostatic testing of pressure hoses.

c. Service. Operations required periodically to keep an item in proper operating condition, i.e., to clean
(includes decontaminate, when required), to preserve, to drain, to paint, or to replenish fuel, lubricants, chemical fluids, or gases. This includes scheduled exercising and purging of recoil mechanisms. The following are examples of service functions:
1. Unpack. To remove from packing box for service or when required for the performance of maintenance operations.

2. Repack. To return item to packing box after service and other maintenance operations. 3. Clean. To rid the item of contamination. 4. Touch up. To spot paint scratched or blistered surfaces. 5. Mark. To restore obliterated identification.

d. Adjust. To maintain or regulate, within prescribed limits, by bringing into proper or exact position, or by setting the operating characteristics to specified parameters.

e. Align. To adjust specified variable elements of an item to bring about optimum or desired performance.

f. Calibrate. To determine and cause corrections to be made or to be adjusted on instruments or test, measuring, and diagnostic equipment used in precision measurement. Consists of comparisons of two instruments, one of which is a certified standard of known accuracy, to detect and adjust any discrepancy in the accuracy of the instrument being compared.

g. Remove/Install. To remove and install the same item when required to perform service or other maintenance functions. Install may be the act of emplacing, seating, or fixing into position a spare, repair part, or module (component or assembly) in a manner to allow the proper functioning of an equipment or system.

h. Paint. To prepare and spray color coats of paint so that the ammunition can be identified and protected. The color indicating primary use is applied, preferably, to the entire exterior surface as the background color of the item. Other markings are to be repainted as original so as to retain proper ammunition identification.

i. Replace. To remove an unserviceable item and install a serviceable counterpart in its place. "Replace" is authorized by the MAC and assigned maintenance level is shown as the 3d position code of the Source, Maintenance and Recoverability (SMR) code.

j. Repair. The application of maintenance services, including fault location/troubleshooting, removal/installation, and disassembly/assembly procedures, and maintenance actions to identify troubles and restore serviceability to an item by correcting specific damage, fault, malfunction, or failure in a part, subassembly, module (component or assembly), end item, or system.

NOTE
The following definitions are applicable to the "repair" maintenance function: Services. Inspect, test, service, adjust, align, calibrate, and/or replace. Fault location/troubleshooting. The process of investigating and detecting the cause of equipment malfunctioning; the act of isolating a fault within a system or Unit Under Test (UUT). Disassembly/assembly. The step-by-step breakdown (taking apart) of a spare/functional group coded item to the level of its least component, that is assigned a SMR code for the level of maintenance under consideration (i.e., identified as maintenance significant). Actions. Welding, grinding, riveting, straightening, facing, machining, and/or resurfacing.

k. Overhaul. That maintenance effort (service/action) prescribed to restore an item to a completely serviceable/operational condition as required by maintenance standards in appropriate technical publications. Overhaul is normally the highest degree of maintenance performed by the Army. Overhaul does not normally return an item to like new condition.

l. Rebuild. Consists of those services/actions necessary for the restoration of unserviceable equipment to a like new condition in accordance with original manufacturing standards. Rebuild is the highest degree of materiel maintenance applied to Army equipment. The rebuild operation includes the act of returning to zero those age measurements (e.g., hours/miles) considered in classifying Army equipment/components.

## B-3. Explanation Of Columns In The Mac, Section Ii

a. Column (1)-Group Number. Column 1 lists FGC numbers, the purpose of which is to identify maintenance significant components, assemblies, subassemblies, and modules with the Next Higher Assembly (NHA).

b. Column (2)-Component/Assembly. Column 2 contains the item names of components, assemblies, subassemblies, and modules for which maintenance is authorized.

c. Column (3)-Maintenance Function. Column 3 lists the functions to be performed on the item listed in Column 2. (For detailed explanation of these functions, refer to "Maintenance Functions: outlined above.)
d. Column (4)-Maintenance Level. Column 4 specifies each level of maintenance authorized to perform the function listed in Column 3. This work time figure represents the active time required to perform that maintenance function at the indicated level of maintenance. If the number or complexity of the tasks within the listed maintenance function varies at different maintenance levels, appropriate work time figures are to be shown for each level. The work time figure represents the average time required to restore an item (assembly, subassembly, component, module, end item, or system) to a serviceable condition under typical field operating conditions. This time includes preparation time (including any necessary disassembly/assembly time) troubleshooting/fault location time, and quality assurance/quality control time in addition to the time required to perform the specific tasks identified for the maintenance functions authorized in the MAC chart. The symbol designations for the various maintenance levels are as follows:
Field:
C Operator or Crew maintenance O Unit maintenance F Direct Support maintenance Sustainment:
L Specialized Repair Activity H General Support maintenance D Depot maintenance

The "L" maintenace level is not included in column (4) of the MAC. Functions to this level of maintenance are identified by work time figure in the "H" column of column (4), and an associated reference code is used in the REMARKS column (6). This code is keyed to the remarks and the SRA complete repair application is explained there.

e. Column (5)-Tools and Equipment Code. Column 5 specifies, by code, those common tool sets (not individual tools), common Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE), and special tools, special TMDE and special support equipment required to perform the designated function. Codes are keyed to the entries in the tools and test equipment table.

f. Column (6)-Remarks Code. When applicable, this column contains a letter code, in alphabetic order, which is keyed to the remarks table entries.

## B-4. Explanation Of Columns In Tool And Test Equipment Requirements, Section Iii

a. Column (1)-Reference Code. The tool and test equipment reference code correlates with a code used in the MAC, section II, column 5.

b. Column (2)-Maintenance Category. The lowest category of maintenance authorized to use the tool or test equipment.

c. Column (3)-Nomenclature. Name or identification of the tool or test equipment. d. Column (4)-National Stock Number. The National stock number of the tool or test equipment. e. Column (5)-Tool Number. The manufacturer's part number.

Figure D-102. Winch Wire Rope Assembly.

## Instructions:

1. (a) Properly seize wire rope end before cutting. To seize wire rope end, follow these instructions:
NOTE
· Ensure each wrap is tight to the preceding wrap.

· Ensure the length of the seizing is not less than the diameter of the wire rope.

(1) Wrap the seizing wire around the wire rope as tight as possible.

(2) Twist the ends of the seizing together by hand counterclockwise so that the twist is near the middle of the seizing.

Do not try to tighten the seizing by twisting.

(3) Tighten the twist just enough to take up the slack.

(4) Tighten the seizing by prying the twist away from the axis of the wire rope.

(5) Tighten the twist again as described in step 3. (6) Repeat the process until the seizing can not be pried away from the axis of the wire rope.

(7) Cut off wire ends and pound the twist into contact with the seizing.

(b)  Cut wire rope to length as shown and install part of clamp with nut on wire rope.

# Section Ii. Illustrated Manufacturing Instructions (Cont'D)

2. Position rope after seizing in a suitable fixture to make a loop, leaving enough rope to wrap around thimble and enclose in clamp.

3. Thread wire rope through eyelid in hook, insert thimble and close jaws of fixture to enable rope to conform to groove of thimble.

4. Place one-half of clamp in position and adjust rope accordingly. The seized portion of the wire rope should equal one rope diameter and protrude entirely beyond the threaded end of the clamp half.

5. Install clamp nut. Holding both threaded halves in position, push the nut into both halves through the first two threads. Ensure proper alignment of both threaded halves and that there is no crossthreading.

6. Remove rope, clamp, and thimble while still connected. 7. Hold opposing flats of clamp halves in suitable fixture and properly lubricate exposed threads with high-viscosity lubricating oil.

8. Using a permanent marker, mark one flat nut to ensure the same opposing flats are checked before and after tightening the clamp.

9. Using calipers, measure 1/8 in. (3.16 mm) across the flat nut from the bottom and note measurement.

10. Check to ensure clamp halves are properly secured in fixture and tighten with appropriate wrench. 11. Using calipers, again take measurement of the same flat nut as was done before tightening of the nut.

If the increment dilation is between 0.004 in. (.102 mm) and 0.007 in. (.178 mm), clamp is tight.

12. Using arbor press, crimp terminal to opposite end of wire rope.

# Appendix E Torque Limits

This section provides general torque limits for screws used on the ECV series vehicles. Special torque limits are indicated in the maintenance procedures for applicable components. The general torque limits given in this appendix shall be used when specific torque limits are not indicated in the maintenance procedure. These general torque limits cannot be applied to screws that retain rubber components. The rubber components will be damaged before the correct torque limit is reached. If a special torque limit is not given in the maintenance instructions, tighten the screw or nut until it touches the metal bracket, then tighten it one more turn. 

#### E-2. Torque Limits

Table E-l lists dry torque limits. Dry torque limits are used on screws that do not have lubricants applied to the threads. Table E-2 lists wet torque limits. Wet torque limits are used on screws that have highpressure lubricants applied to the threads. For metric fasteners, refer to table E-3 for torque limit requirements. 

#### 1 E-3. How To Use Torque Table 1 

![2656_Image_0.Png](2656_Image_0.Png)

a. Measure the diameter of the screw you are 

![2656_image_2.png](2656_image_2.png)

installing. 

b. Count the number of threads per inch. 

c. Under the heading SIZE, look down the left hand column until you find the diameter of the screw you are installing (there will usually be two lines beginning with the same size). 

d. In the second column under SIZE, find the number of threads per inch that matches the number of threads you counted in step b. 

#### Capscrew Head Markings

Manufacturer's marks may Metric screws are of three vary. These are all SAE Grade grades: 8.8, 10.9, and 12.9. 

5 (3-line). Grades & Manufacturer's marks appear on the screw head. 

![2656_image_1.png](2656_image_1.png)

e. To find the grade screw you are installing, match the markings on the head to the correct picture of CAPSCREW HEAD MARKINGS on the torque table. 

f. Look down the column under the picture you found in step e. until you find the torque limit
