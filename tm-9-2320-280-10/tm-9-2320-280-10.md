# .Warning. Exhaust Gases Can Kill

Brain damage or death can result from heavy exposure. Precautions must be followed to ensure crew safety when the personnel heater or engine of any vehicle is operated for any purpose.

1. Do not operate your vehicle engine in enclosed areas. 2. Do not idle vehicle engine with vehicle windows closed. 3. Be alert at all times for exhaust odors. 4. Be alert for exhaust poisoning symptoms. They are:
- Headache - Dizziness - Sleepiness - Loss of muscular control 5. If you see another person with exhaust poisoning symptoms:
- Remove person from area - Expose to open air - Keep person warm - Do not permit physical exercise - Administer artificial respiration, if necessary* - Notify a medic
*For artificial respiration, refer to FM 21-11.

6. BE AWARE, the field protective mask and ambulance Nuclear-BiologicalChemical (NBC) system will not protect you from exhaust poisoning.

THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST EXHAUST POISONING IS ADEQUATE VENTILATION.

## Warning Summary

- Never open one end of cargo shell door without first ensuring that the opposite end is securely closed. Not doing so may cause both ends to open at the same time, causing damage to equipment, mission abort, or injury to personnel.

- Drycleaning solvent is flammable and will not be used near an open flame. 

A fire extinguisher will be kept nearby when the solvent is used. Use only in well-ventilated places. Failure to do this may result in injury to personnel and/or damage to equipment.

- Protective gloves, clothing, and/or respiratory equipment must be worn whenever caustic, toxic, or flammable cleaning solutions are used. Failure to do this may result in injury to personnel and/or damage to equipment.

- Do not perform fuel or battery system checks, inspections, or maintenance while smoking or near sparks. Fuel may ignite and batteries may explode causing damage to vehicle and injury or death to personnel.

- The automatic transmissions on M998 and "A1" vehicles do not have a "PARK"
position. Whenever the vehicle is parked, or the transmission is in "NEUTRAL," the parking brake MUST BE APPLIED. Damage to equipment and injury to personnel may occur if these instructions are not followed.

- The automatic transmissions on M1123 and "A2" vehicles have a "PARK"
position. Never use the transmission shift lever in place of the parking brake. Set the parking brake. Ensure the transmission shift lever in in the "P" (park) position and transfer case shift lever is NOT in the "N" (neutral) position. Damage to equipment and injury to personnel may occur if these instructions are not followed.

- Ensure all slack from two-point seatbelt adjusting strap or three-point seatbelt is removed. Two-point seatbelt retracts but does not lock in any position. Threepoint seatbelt retracts and will lock only during sudden stops or impact. Injury to personnel will result if an accident occurs and seatbelts are not in use or adjusted properly.

- Extreme caution shall be taken when transporting personnel. Rollover protection and seatbelts are available for the crew area only and are not provided in the troop/cargo area. Despite certain design characteristics of the vehicle, such as improved capabilities, failure to use basic safe driving skills may result in injury or death to personnel and damage to equipment.

- Operators are reminded to observe basic safe driving techniques/skills when operating vehicle. Vehicle speed must be reduced consistent with weather and road/terrain conditions. Obstacles such as stumps and boulders must be avoided.

- This vehicle has been designed to operate safely and efficiently within the limits specified in this TM. Operations beyond these limits are prohibited IAW AR 750-1 without written approval from the Commander, U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, ATTN: AMSTA-CM-S, Warren, MI 48397-5000. 

- Prior to towing vehicle with rear wheels up, secure steering wheel to prevent front wheels from turning. 

- Wear leather gloves when handling winch cable. Do not handle cable with bare hands. When fully extending winch cable, ensure that four wraps of winch cable remain on drum at all times. Direct all personnel to stand clear of winch cable during winch operation. Failure to do this may cause damage to vehicle and injury or death to personnel.

## Warning Summary (Cont'D)

- Avoid using fire extinguisher in unventilated areas. Prolonged inhalation exposure to extinguishing agent or fumes from burning material may cause injury to personnel. Using fire extinguisher in windy area will cause rapid dispersal of extinguishing agent and reduce effectiveness in fire control.

- Vehicle operation in snow is a hazardous condition. Operator must travel at reduced speeds and be prepared to meet sudden changes in road conditions. Pump brakes gradually when stopping vehicle on ice or snow. Sudden braking will cause wheels to lock and vehicle to slide out of control causing damage to vehicle and injury or death to personnel.

- Do not rely on wet service brakes. Keep applying brakes until they dry out and uneven braking ceases. Failure to do this may cause damage to vehicle and injury or death to personnel.

- Exhaust components are hot after prolonged vehicle use. Ensure exhaust system components are cool before removing/installing exhaust assembly. Failure to do this will result in injury to personnel.

- Do not use the hand throttle as an automatic speed or cruise control. The hand throttle does not automatically disengage when brake is applied, resulting in increased stopping distances and possible hazardous and unsafe operation. Injury to personnel or damage to equipment may result.

- Do not operate heater when ventilation system is on. Damage to heater or injury to personnel will result.

- To ensure opening of the hood assembly is accomplished safely and effectively, always maintain the proper lifting posture, legs bent with back straight. When raising and securing hood, make sure the hood prop rod is secured to hood support bracket. When releasing hood prop rod, do not pull rod at hook end. Damage to equipment or injury to personnel will occur if hood is not raised, secured, and lowered properly.

- If NBC exposure is suspected, all air filter media should be handled by personnel wearing protective equipment. Consult your unit NBC officer or NBC NCO for appropriate handling or disposal instructions.

- Radial and bias ply tires should not be mixed on the same vehicle. Injury to personnel or damage to equipment may result.

- Do not use bias ply tires on the M1097, M1123, or any A1 and A2 models, under any condition. Due to tire load ratings and vehicle load carrying capabilities, only the load range "D" radial tire can be used on the M1097, M1123, and all A1 and A2 models.

- For M1097, M1123, and all A1 and A2 model vehicles only, hearing protection is required for driver and passengers when engine is running. Noise levels produced by these vehicles exceed 85 dBA, which may cause injury to personnel.

- The Department of Transportation requires 105 mm cannon ammunition to be in wooden boxes when transporting ammunition on public highways. Movement of cannon ammunition in fiber containers (inner pack) in the vehicle ammunition rack is restricted to other than public highways.

- Do not operate the vehicle without the windshield assembly positioned upright and the "B" pillar securely attached. Operation of the vehicle without these structures in place may result in injury to personnel and damage to equipment.

#### Tm 9-2320-280-10

## Warning Summary (Cont'D)

- Communication shelters AN/GRC-122 and AN/GRC-142 RATT may overload vehicle by up to 500 pounds. Use caution when driving to avoid damage to equipment or injury to personnel.

- Chock blocks shall be used when parking a vehicle with inoperative parking brakes, when operating in extreme cold conditions, when parking on inclines, or whenever and wherever maintenance is being performed. Failure to do so may result in injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- Vehicle speed must be reduced consistent with weather and road/terrain conditions. Obstacles such as stumps and boulders must be avoided. Failure to use basic safe driving techniques/skills may result in injury or death to personnel and damage to equipment.

- Do not use tow pintle as a step when entering or exiting vehicle cargo area.

Failure to do so may result in injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

# 2-5. Preventive Maintenance Checks And Services (Pmcs)

a. Designated Intervals.

Designated intervals are performed under usual operating conditions. PMCS intervals must be performed more frequently when operating under unusual conditions.

(1) BEFORE checks and services of PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE must be performed prior to placing vehicle or its components in operation.

(2) DURING checks and services of PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE must be performed while the vehicle and/or its components/systems are in operation.

(3) AFTER checks and services of PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE are performed upon completion of mission.

(4) WEEKLY checks and services of PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE are performed once every 7 days.

(5) MONTHLY checks and services of PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE are performed once every 30 days.

b. Procedures.

(1) For troubleshooting malfunctions, refer to table 3-1 or notify your supervisor.

(2) Use DA Form 2404 or DA Form 5988-E (automated) and report malfunctions to unit maintenance at once.

(3) Tools included with vehicle are to be used when making PREVENTIVE
MAINTENANCE checks and services. Wiping cloths are needed to remove dirt or grease.

(4) Refer to appropriate TMs for PMCS requirements on mounted systems
(i.e., TOW missiles systems, radios, etc.).

(5) When performing lubrication procedures, you should be familiar with the equipment. Notify organizational maintenance or your supervisor if you have any questions relating to lubrication points.

#### C. Troublespots. Note

Dirt, grease, oil, and debris may cover up a serious problem. Clean as you check. Following precautions printed on container, use drycleaning solvent (SD-3) on all metal surfaces. On rubber or plastic material, use soap and water.

(1) Check all bolts, nuts, and screws. If loose, bent, broken, or missing, either tighten or report conditions to unit maintenance.

(2) Look for loose or chipped paint, and rust or cracks at welds. Remove rust and loose paint, and spot paint as required. If a cracked weld is found, report situation to unit maintenance.

(3) Inspect electrical wires and connectors for cracked or broken insulation.

Also look for bare wires, and loose or broken connections. Tighten loose connections. Report other problems to unit maintenance.

(4) Check hoses and fluid lines for wear, damage, and leaks. Ensure clamps and fittings are tight. (Refer to para. 2-6 for information on leaks.)
(5) Check hinges for security and operation. (6) Check data, caution, and warning plates for security and legibility.

#### 2-5. Preventative Maintenance Checks And Services (Pmcs)

# (Cont'D)

d. **Not Ready/Available**. If a vehicle is not able to perform the mission, equipment will be reported as not ready/available. Refer to DA Pam 738-750.

e. **Correct Assembly or Stowage**. Check each component for installation as an assembly, in the right place, and with no missing parts.

## 2-6. Fluid Leakage.

Wetness around seals, gaskets, fittings, or connections indicates leakage. A stain also denotes leakage. If a fitting or connector is loose, tighten it. If broken or defective, report it. Use the following as a guide:
a. **Class I.** Leakage indicated by wetness or discoloration, but not great enough to form drops.

b. **Class II.** Leakage great enough to form drops, but not enough to cause drops to drip from item being checked/inspected.

c. **Class III.** Leakage great enough to form drops that fall from the item being checked/inspected.

Operation is allowable with Class I or II leakage except for brake system. Any brake fluid leakage must be reported. WHEN IN DOUBT, NOTIFY YOUR SUPERVISOR. When operating with Class I or II leaks, check fluid levels more frequently. Class III leaks must be reported immediately to your supervisor or to unit maintenance. Failure to do this will result in damage to vehicle and/or components.

#### 2-7. Lubrication Requirements

For lubrication requirements and procedures, refer to appendix G.

Table 2-2. *Preventive Maintenance Checks and Services (Cont'd)*

# Section Iii. Operation Under Usual Conditions

## 2-8. General

This section provides instructions for vehicle operations under moderate temperature, humidity, and terrain conditions. For vehicle operation under unusual conditions, refer to section IV of this chapter.

Before you operate your vehicle, be sure to perform the preventive maintenance checks and services shown in table 2-2.

## 2-9. Break-In Service

a. Perform all before operation checks and services as indicated in table 2-2. b. Upon receipt of vehicle, or after engine replacement, the following break-in speeds and precautions should be observed during the first 500 miles (805 km) of operation:
- Do not exceed a speed of 55 miles per hour (89 kilometers per hour). - Do not drive for long periods of time at constant speed. - Avoid rapid acceleration or deceleration. - Drive at a moderate speed until the engine is fully warmed up. - No trailer towing.

## 2-10. Starting The Engine

- The automatic transmissions on M998 and "A1" vehicles do not have a "PARK" position. Whenever the vehicle is parked, or the transmission in in "NEUTRAL", the parking brake MUST BE APPLIED. Damage to equipment and injury to personnel may occur if these instructions are not followed.

- The automatic transmissions on the M1123 and"A2" vehicles have a "PARK" position. Never use the transmission shift lever in place of the parking brake. Set the parking brake. Make sure the transmission shift lever is in the "P" (park) position and transfer case shift lever is NOT in the "N" (neutral) position. Damage to equipment and injury to personnel may occur if these instructions are not followed.

- Chock blocks will be used when parking a vehicle with inoperative parking brakes, when operating in extreme cold conditions, when parking on inclines, or whenever and wherever maintenance is being performed. Failure to do so may result in injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- For M1097, M1123, and all A1 and A2 model vehicles only, hearing protection is required for driver and passengers when engine is running. Noise levels produced by these vehicles exceed 85 dBA, which may cause injury to personnel.

To apply parking brake, grasp handle firmly and pull upward until handle is locked in a straight-up position.

a. Ensure parking brake is applied. b. Adjust driver's seat (para. 2-14).

Visibility may be restricted with right rearview mirror.

c. Adjust left and right rearview mirrors. Ensure both mirrors provide a clear view (para. 3-24 or 3-25).

d. Ensure all windows are clean. If not, clean windows before attempting to move vehicle (refer to table 2-1).

Ensure all slack from two-point seatbelt adjusting strap or threepoint seatbelt is removed. Two-point seatbelt retracts but does not lock in any position. Three-point seatbelt retracts and will lock only during sudden stops or impact. Injury to personnel will result if an accident occurs and seatbelt is not used or adjusted properly.

Fasten unused seatbelts to protect the belt ends from damage or dirt contamination.

e. Fasten and adjust seatbelt (para. 2-16). f. Place transmission shift lever (8) in "N" (neutral) and transfer case shift lever (7) in desired range. See table 1-9 for transfer case range selection.

- Do not leave rotary switch in "RUN" position for extended periods of time. Glow plugs will continue to cycle and batteries will discharge leading to a no-start condition.

- Glare from the sun may make it difficult to tell if the wait-tostart lamp assembly is illuminated. If this occurs, shade the light with your hands to ensure that the wait-to-start lamp assembly goes out before attempting to start the vehicle.

- Starting the engine before the wait-to-start lamp goes out can result in starting problems.

f.1. Ensure all electrical switches (e.g. lights, wipers, and blower motor) in

![163_image_0.png](163_image_0.png)

vehicle are turned to "OFF".

g. Place rotary switch (1) to "RUN" and wait until WAIT-TO-START lamp assembly (2) goes out.

2-106 Change 3

· If ambient temperature is above 0°F (-18°C), do not operate starter continuously for more than 20 seconds; wait 10 to 15 seconds between periods of starter operation. Failure to do this will result in damage to the starter.

· If any instrument reading is not normal, stop engine. Failure to do this will result in damage to the engine.

Refer to troubleshooting, table 3-1.

· If engine does not start, leave rotary switch in "RUN" position and wait 10 to 15 seconds before trying to restart. Failure to do this will result in damage to glow plugs or starter.

· If you accidentally turn the rotary switch to "ENG STOP" position after an unsuccessful attempt to start, wait 90 seconds before trying to restart. Failure to do this will result in damage to glow plugs.

h. Place rotary switch (1) to 'START." Release lever after engine starts. Lever will return automatically to "RUN".

Before the engine reaches operating temperature, the WAIT-TO-
START lamp may flicker and a clicking noise may be heard. This is due to glow plug relay cycling and is a normal condition.

i. Allow engine to warm up for approximately one minute and ensure instruments indicate the following:
(1) Oil pressure gauge (4) should register above approximately 6 psi (41 kPa) with engine at idle. (2) Voltmeter (6) should register in green area. (3) Fuel gauge (9) should indicate fuel level in fuel tank. (4) Air restriction gauge (3) should not register within the red zone.

j. Stop engine if any of the following conditions occur:
(1) Excessive engine vibration. (2) Oil pressure does not register or suddenly drops to or less than approximately 6 psi (41 kPa) with engine at idle.

(3) Air restriction gauge (3) is within the red zone.

k. If engine overheating occurs:
(1) Park vehicle, allow engine to idle. (2) Observe coolant temperature gauge (5) for steady cooling.

Stop engine if coolant temperature gauge suddenly increases beyond approximately 230°F (110°C), or damage to engine will result.

(3) If engine coolant temperature continues to increase, or does not decrease, as indicated by engine temperature gauge (5), stop engine. Perform troubleshooting procedures in table 3-1.

## 2-25. Trailer Towing

Towing trailers too large or too small for the vehicle capacity is dangerous. These trailers do not track vehicle properly, cargo shifting occurs, and the likelihood of trailer capsizing during movement is increased. This could result in damage to equipment, and injury or death to personnel.

Be sure to close tailgate before towing trailer. Failure to do so may cause damage to the master cylinder.

- Towing any trailer with a HMMWV other than the authorized M116 series, M101 series, M1101, and M1102 trailers or a M102 howitzer is not authorized.

- When towing a trailer, the maximum safe slope is reduced from 40% to 30%.

All vehicles are capable of towing M116 Series and M101 Series trailers and the M102 Howitzer. The M998 Series and A1 Series have a maximum towed load capacity of 3,400 lb. The Heavy Variant (M1097, M1097A1, M1097A2 and M1123) and A2 Series have a maximum towed load capacity of 4,200 lb. Only vehicles that have been retrofitted with MWO 9-2320-280-20-6 Airlift Bumper Reinforcement, or MWO 9-2320-280-20-7 Crossmember Reinforcement, are authorized to tow M1101 and M1102 trailers. Due to the numerous model differences, you must refer to Table 2-3.1 to determine towing authorization for the M1101 and M1102.

Change 2 2-132.1 The ambulances are authorized to tow trailers only during administrative or tactical moves, when not transporting patients. Trailer payloads should be evenly distributed to prevent excessive tongue loads.

## 2-26. Electric Winch Operation

a. General. The vehicle electrical system is used to power the winch. It is recommended to have engine running while operating the winch so the alternator recharges the battery. Increased engine rpms can be maintained by use of the hand throttle. When engaging or disengaging the clutch, it may be necessary to rotate the drum by hand to align gears.

#### B. Preparation For Use. Note

The eye of the winch cable needs a thimble to keep wires from shearing or breaking. Refer to unit maintenance for installation.

(1) Park vehicle directly facing object to be winched. Place transmission shift lever in "N" (neutral), or "P" (Park) for M1123 and A2 vehicles.

(2) Apply parking brake. (3) Start engine (para. 2-10). (4) Chock wheels.

c. Unwinding Winch Cable.

Do not power out winch cable for more than 10 ft (3 m). Use free spool for paying out long lengths of winch cable. Failure to free spool long lengths of winch cable will cause damage to winch.

(1) Turn clutch lever (1) counterclockwise to "FREE SPOOL."

- Wear leather gloves when handling winch cable. Do not handle cable with bare hands.

- When fully extending winch cable, ensure that four wraps of winch cable remain on drum at all times. Failure to do this may cause injury or death to personnel.

Allow 1 ft (30.5 cm) of slack in winch cable prior to start of winching operations. This allows time for winch motor start-up for maximum pulling power.

(2) Pull out cable (5) by hand to desired length. Connect to load leaving 1 ft (30.5 cm) of slack in cable (5).

#### D. Pulling Load. Note

Refer to table 1-16 (6,000 lb), or table 1-17 (Optional 9,000 lb), Winch Data, for pulling load capacity.

(1) Remove remote control switch (3) from stowage box (4). (2) Turn clutch lever (1) clockwise to "ENGAGED."

Direct all personnel to stand clear of winch cable during winch operation. A snapped winch cable will cause injury or death.

- The electric winch is equipped with an electronic current limiter

![195_image_0.png](195_image_0.png)

switch to prevent winch overload. If winch stops repeatedly during operation and restarts in approximately five seconds, the electronic current limiter is being activated, indicating an overload condition.

- The electric winch is equipped with a thermal cutoff switch to prevent winch from overheating. If winch stops during operation, and does not restart within five seconds, wait approximately two minutes to let winch cool off and allow thermal switch to reset. If after five minutes winch is still inoperative, notify unit maintenance.

Do not fully apply hand throttle during engine "NO LOAD" condition. Damage to engine may result.

(3) Pull out hand throttle until desired engine speed is obtained. (4) Operate remote control switch (3) to "IN" or "OUT" until load has been retrieved.

e. Securing Winch After Operation.

Winch cable must be wound onto the drum under a load of at least 500 lbs (227 kg) or outer wraps will draw into the inner wraps and damage winch cable.

(1) Wind winch cable (5) until hook (2) is 4 ft (1.2 m) from cable guide (6). (2) Turn clutch lever (1) counterclockwise to "FREE SPOOL" and rotate drum by hand to retrieve the remaining cable.

(3) Place remote control switch (3) in stowage box (4). (4) Turn clutch lever (1) clockwise to "ENGAGED." (5) Release hand throttle.

#### Change 1 2-134.1

## 2-26.1. Hydraulic Winch Operation

a. General. The vehicle power steering system is used to power winch.

Operating winch requires vehicle to be running. Applying vehicle brakes or turning steering wheel can be done while operating winch, but this may cause winch to stop. To achieve 100% pulling power, do not brake or steer while operating winch. It is possible to pay out vehicle's winch cable without vehicle running. This is accomplished with the freespool method. Keep no less than five cable wraps on drum during all winch operations. 

#### B. Preparation For Use.

(1) Park vehicle directly facing object to be winched and place transmission in "N" (neutral) or "P" (park) for M1123 and A2 vehicles.

(2) Place transfer selector lever in low lock. (3) Apply parking brake. (4) Chock wheels. (5) Start engine (para. 2-10).

c. Unwinding Winch Cable.

(1) Move selector levers (2) and (3) to "FREE". This setting on winch is
"FREESPOOL".

- When fully extending winch cable, ensure that five wraps of winch cable remain on drum at all times. Failure to do this may cause damage to equipment or injury or death to personnel.

- Wear leather gloves when handling winch cable. Do not handle cable with bare hands.

- Do not even slide gloved hands across winch cable. Injury can result.

Allow 1 ft. (30.5 cm) of slack in winch cable prior to start of winching operations. This allows time for winch motor start up for maximum pulling power.

(2) Pull out winch cable (1) to desired length. Connect to load, leaving 1 ft.

(30.5 cm) of slack in cable (1).

(3) If retrieving load by moving vehicle and not winding winch cable, move winch selector levers to "WINCH LOCKED UP" position.

#### 2-134.2 Change 3

![197_image_0.png](197_image_0.png)

#### D. Powering Winch In And Out. Caution

- Do not power out winch cable for more than 50 ft. (15.3 m). Use free spool for paying out long lengths of winch cable. Failure to free spool long lengths of winch cable will cause damage to winch.

- Wind winch cable onto drum under a load of at least 500 lb (227 kg) or outer wraps will draw into inner wraps and damage winch cable. 

- Do not move winch selector levers with load on winch or when powering winch in or out. Moving winch selector levers with load on winch or when powering winch may cause damage to winch.

- Refer to table 1-17.1 (optional 10,500 lb.), Winch Data for Pulling Capacity.

- Wrapping winch cable is essential and should be done as soon as winch is applied to vehicle. This procedure ensures winch cable is tight on drum and should be accomplished during monthly PMCS, or if winch cable has been powered or freespooled out more than 50% of cable length.

(1) Align drum gears.

(a) Remove remote control (6) from storage compartment (7) under passenger seat.

(b) Remove cap (10) from controller plug (8) and connect hand controller connector (9) to controller plug (8).

"LOCK LOW GEAR" is the preferred winch speed for all recovery and wrapping operations.

(c) Move winch selector lever (1) to "LOW". Move winch selector lever
(5) to "FREE".

Direct all personnel to stand clear of winch cable during winch operation. A snapped winch cable may cause injury or death.

Do not move winch levers with load on winch or when powering winch in or out.

(d) Power winch in and out with no load on cable for 1/2 second at a time until full engagement is accomplished. 

(2) Attach winch cable (3) to load. Press "OUT" remote control button (11)
or "IN" remote control button (12) until load has been retrieved.

This winch uses right-lay bottom feed method of winch cable on winch drum. Ensure cable wrap begins from right side of winch drum.

(3) Power in winch cable (3), ensuring cable wraps (2) are tight. (4) Continue powering in winch cable (3) under load until approximately four feet (1.2 m) from hook. Disconnect load and power in, keeping cable taut, until hook clevis touches fairlead roller (13). Clevis should hang freely with less than one foot (.31 m) of cable exposed.

#### E. Securing Winch After Operation.

(1) Move levers (1) and (5) to "FREE" positions and rotate drum by hand

![199_image_0.png](199_image_0.png)

to retrieve remaining cable.

# Section Iv. Operation Under Unusual Conditions

## 2-28. Special Instructions

a. **General.** Special instructions for operating and maintaining vehicles under unusual conditions are included in this section. Unusual conditions are extreme temperatures, humidity, and/or terrain. Special care in cleaning and lubrication must be taken in order to keep vehicles operational when operating under unusual conditions.

This vehicle has been designed to operate safely and efficiently within the limits specified in this TM. Operation beyond these limits is prohibited IAW AR 750-1 without written approval from the Commander, U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, ATTN: AMSTA-CM-S, Warren, MI 48397-5000.

NOTE
Except where noted, all normal operating procedures will apply in addition to special instructions for unusual operating conditions.

b. **Cleaning.** Refer to para. 2-4 for cleaning instructions and precautions. c . **L u b r i c a t i o n .** Refer to appendix G for proper lubricating instructions. d. **Driving Instructions.**
(1) FM 21-305, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Driver, contains special driving instructions for operating wheeled vehicles.

(2) FM 55-30, Army Motor Transport Unit Operations, contains instructions on driver selection, training, and supervision.

(3) FM 9-207, Operation and Maintenance of Ordnance Materiel in Cold Weather, contains instructions on vehicle operation in extreme cold of 0°F to -65°F (-18°C to -54°C).

(4) Other documents with information on vehicle operation under unusual conditions are:
(a) FM 31-70 Basic Cold Weather Manual **( d )** FM 90-5 Jungle Operations ( b ) FM 31-71 Northern Operations **( e )** FM 90-6 Mountain Operations ( c ) FM 90-3 Desert Operations e . **Special Purpose Kits.** Paragraphs describing special purpose kits for operation under unusual conditions are:
( 1 ) Deep water fording operation, para. 2-37. ( 2 ) Arctic operation, para. 2-39 or 2-40.

f . **Transmission Range Selection.** For proper transmission range selection, refer to table 1-7 or table 1-8. If transmission range selection is peculiar to an unusual operating condition, it will be specified in the applicable paragraph.

g . **Transfer Case Range Selection.**

- Vehicle must be stopped, engine off, and transmission shift lever in "N" (neutral) before transfer case can be shifted. Failure to do this will result in damage to drivetrain.

- Damage to drivetrain will result if transfer case is operated in "L"
(low range) or "H/L" (high lock range) on high traction surfaces with no wheel slippage.

When necessary to temporarily operate transfer case in "H/L" (high lock range) or "L" (low range) when additional traction is needed to prevent wheel slippage, avoid sharp continuous turns. Failure to avoid sharp continuous turns while operating transfer case in locked ranges may cause damage to drivetrain. Immediately after operation in "H/L" (high lock range) or "L" (low range), ensure transfer case is shifted to "H" (high range) to avoid damage to drivetrain. If any noises from drivetrain components are heard, ensure that transfer case range is properly selected.

For proper transfer case range selection, refer to table 1-9. If transfer case range selection is peculiar to an unusual operating condition, it will be specified in the applicable paragraph.

#### 2-29. Operating On Unusual Terrain

a. General Rules. Driving off-road over rough or unusual terrain basically requires using good driving sense. Experience is the best teacher, but there are a few good rules to keep in mind when you are in that kind of driving situation.

Use extreme caution when transporting personnel. Rollover protection is available for the crew area only and is not provided in the troop/cargo area. Although certain design characteristics of the vehicle, such as vehicle width, ground clearance, independent suspension, etc., provide improved capabilities, accidents can still happen.

Operators are reminded to observe basic safe driving techniques/skills when operating the vehicle, especially when transporting personnel. Vehicle speed must be reduced consistent with weather and road/terrain conditions. Obstacles such as stumps and boulders must be avoided. Failure to use basic safe driving techniques/skills may result in injury or death to personnel and damage to equipment.

(1) Use "H/L" (high lock range) or "L" (low range) only when absolutely required by the conditions identified in table 1-9. After operations on unusual terrain, be sure to shift the transfer case from "H/L" (high lock range) or "L" (low range) to "H" (high range) to avoid damaging drivetrain components.

(2) Select proper transmission and transfer case driving ranges. Refer to table 1-7 or table 1-8 for transmission range selections. For transfer case range selections, refer to table 1-9.

(3) Keep engine at a moderate speed. The engine works at its best pace in the mid-range revolutions per minute (rpms). You can slow down or speed up quickly without changing gears if you get into a tight spot. Use the transmission shift lever and transfer case shift lever to control the engine speed.

(4) Attempt to keep wheels from spinning. If the wheels start to spin, ease off the accelerator pedal until the wheels regain traction.

(5) The instructions for placing vehicle in motion (para. 2-11) also apply to operating on unusual terrain.

#### 2-138 B. **Unusual Terrain Driving Techniques** Caution

- Do not shift into any lower gear than is necessary to maintain h e a d w a y. Attempt to maintain a constant engine speed. Overrevving engine will cause the wheels to slip, and traction will be lost.

- Before ascending or descending steep hills, stop vehicle, place transmission to "N" (neutral), and shift transfer case to "L" (low range). Failure to shift transfer case to "L" (low range) before ascending or descending steep hills may result in damage to drivetrain.

(1) Before climbing a steep hill, shift the transfer case into "L" (low range)
and the automatic transmission into "1" (first). If wheels start to slip, "walk" the vehicle the last few remaining feet of a hill by swinging the front wheels sharply left and right if situation permits. This action will provide fresh "bite" into the surface and will usually result in enough traction to complete the climb.

When "L" (low range) is used for "engine braking" while descending steep grades, avoid sharp continuous turns. Failure to avoid sharp continuous turns while operating transfer case in range may cause damage to drivetrain.

(2) You can proceed safely down a steep grade by shifting the transfer case into
"L" (low range) and the transmission into "2" (second) or "1" (first). Let the vehicle go slowly down the hill with all four wheels turning against engine compression.

Do not travel diagonally across a hill unless it is absolutely necessary, or injury to personnel or damage to equipment may result.

(3) When moving across a slope, choose the least angle possible, keep moving, and avoid turning quickly.

(4) If it is difficult to shift out of a locked range, drivetrain torque buildup may have occured. If necessary to relieve drivetrain torque buildup when leaving a low traction surface for a high traction surface, the vehicle should be backed up for a distance of approximately 5 ft (1.5 m) before proceeding.

## 2-30. Cold Weather Starting Below +32°F (0°C)

Starting aids will not be used on the engine. Use of starting aids will cause damage to vehicle, injury, or death.

(1) Start engine (para. 2-10).

- Do not use the hand throttle as an automatic speed or cruise control. The hand throttle does not automatically disengage when brake is applied, resulting in increased stopping distances and possible hazardous and unsafe operation.

- Do not fully apply hand throttle when engine is not under load.

If engine cranks slowly and voltmeter indicates low battery charge level, attempt to slave start vehicle (para. 2-23). If vehicle still will not start, perform troubleshooting procedures in table 3-1.

(2) After engine starts, pull out hand throttle until desired engine speed is obtained. Twist handle to lock hand throttle.

(3) Allow engine to warm up at an increased speed for approximately three minutes.

(4) After warm-up period, unlock hand throttle and push hand throttle in and allow engine speed to decrease.

## 2-31. Operating In Extreme Cold, On Ice, Or Snow

#### A. **Before Operation.**

(1) Operate arctic winterization equipment (para. 2-39 or 2-40). (2) Scrape off any ice accumulated on vehicle. (3) Remove ice and snow from area around air cleaner intake cap. (4) Refer to para. 2-30 for cold weather starting instructions. (5) Refer to para. 2-29 for techniques that can be used when operating on unusual terrain.

(6) Refer to para. 3-22 for tire chain installation and operation. (7) Operate troop/cargo winterization heater, if applicable (para. 2-41).

b. **During Operation.**

- Vehicle operation in snow is a hazardous condition. Operator must travel at reduced speeds and be prepared to meet sudden changes in road conditions. Failure to maintain safe stopping distances will cause damage to vehicle and injury or death to personnel.

- Pump brakes gradually when stopping vehicle on ice or snow.

Sudden braking will cause wheels to lock and vehicle to slide out of control, causing damage to vehicle and injury or death to personnel.

- Chock blocks shall be used when parking a vehicle in extreme cold conditions. Failure to do so may result in injury to personnel or damage to equipment.**NOTE**
Keep area around air cleaner intake cap clear of snow and ice. Snow and ice may melt, refreeze, and cause restriction in air intake system. If necessary, remove intake cap and clear ice and snow without damaging intake cap screen. Hold the cap near the vehicle exhaust to quickly melt ice without damaging screen.

(1) Place transmission shift lever in "D" (drive) (or "oD " overdrive for M1123 and A2 vehicles), and transfer case shift lever in "H/L" (high lock range). Place vehicle in motion slowly to prevent wheels from spinning.

If additional power is needed to extract vehicle when mired in snow, place transmission in "1" (first) and transfer case in "L" (low range). After vehicle is extracted from mired condition, immediately return transfer case to "H/L" (high lock range) position.

(2) If rear skidding occurs:
(a) Let up on accelerator pedal. ( b ) Turn steering wheel in direction of skid until control has been regained. (c) Apply brake pedal in a gradual pumping manner.

c. **After Operation.**
( 1 ) Remove all ice and snow from underside of vehicle and fuel tank filler cap. (2) Drain fuel filter (para. 3-10).

## 2-32. Operating In Dusty, Sandy Areas

a. **General.** Vehicles operating in dusty or sandy areas require frequent servicing of the air filter and cooling system.

NOTE
For dusty conditions, a precleaner, NSN 2940-01-302-8028, can be inserted in the air intake shield assembly, at the discretion of the unit commander.

#### B. **Before Operation.**

(1) Reduce tire inflation to 12 psi (83 kPa) front and 16 psi (110 kPa) rear to increase traction when operating in sand.

(2) When operating in loose sand or soft ground, place transfer case shift lever in "H/L" (high lock range) position and transmission shift lever in "D" (drive) (or " " (overdrive) for M1123 and A2 vehicles).

(3) Refer to paragraph 2-29 for techniques that can be used when operating on unusual terrain.

c. **During Operation.**
D

If additional power is needed to extract vehicle when mired in sand, place transmission in "1" (first) and transfer case in "L" (low range). After vehicle is extracted from mired condition, immediately return transfer case to "H/L" (high lock range) position.

(1) Frequently check air restriction gauge. If indicator shows red, park vehicle, stop engine, and refer to para. 3-15 for emergency air cleaner servicing.

(2) If engine overheating occurs:
(a) Park vehicle, allow engine to idle. (b) Observe coolant temperature gauge for steady cooling.

Stop engine if coolant temperature gauge suddenly increases beyond approximately 230°F (110°C). Failure to comply will result in damage to engine.

(c) If coolant temperature continues to increase or does not lower, stop engine. Perform applicable troubleshooting procedures in table 3-1.

(3) Accelerate slowly so wheels will not spin and dig into sand.

Use a wrecker or second vehicle equipped with winch to recover vehicles mired in deep sand. Do not attempt to "rock" vehicles out of deep sand with quick transmission shift changes. Damage to transmission will occur.

#### D. **After Operation.**

(1) At end of daily operation, remove all sand from accelerator linkage and brake components.

(2) Park vehicle in shade whenever possible to protect tires, soft tops, paint, wood, and seals from sun, dust, and sand.

(3) If shade is not available, cover vehicle with tarpaulin. When entire vehicle cannot be covered, protect windows and hood with tarpaulin to prevent entry of sand or dust.

(4) Vehicles completing operation in dusty, sandy areas must be lubricated and serviced by unit maintenance as soon as possible.

## 2-33. Operating In Mud

a. **Before Operation.**
(1) Before operating in mud, place transfer case shift lever in "H/L" (high lock range) and transmission shift lever in "D" (drive) (or " " (overdrive) for M1123 and A2 vehicles).

(2) Refer to paragraph 2-29 for techniques that can be used when operating on unusual terrain.

b. **During Operation.**
D

- Do not repeatedly shift transmission or overspeed the engine during operation in deep mud. Damage to drivetrain may result.

- Use wrecker or a second vehicle equipped with winch to recover vehicles mired in deep mud. Do not attempt to "rock" vehicles out of deep mud with quick transmission shift changes. Damage to transmission will occur.

If additional power is needed to extract vehicle when mired in mud, place transmission in "1" (first) and transfer case in "L" (low range). After vehicle is extracted from mired condition, immediately return transfer case to "H/L" (high lock range) position.

Skidding and sudden loss of steering control are operating problems in mud.

When rear end skidding occurs, immediately turn wheel in direction of skid.

c. **After Operation.**

#### 2-61. Ambulance Interior Electrical Controls

a. **General**. The vehicle electrical system is used to power the NBC air filtration system, interior lights, heater, air-conditioner, and ventilation system. It is recommended to have engine running while operating the heater, vent, and NBC air filtration system so the alternator maintains battery charge. The engine must be running to operate the air-conditioner compressor.

- Electrical control panels on M996, M996A1, M997, M997A1, and M997A2 ambulances are basically the same (M997 is shown).

- To facilitate blackout operations, M996, M996A1, M997, M997A1, and M997A2 ambulance interior lighting systems have been designed so that all white light illumination in the patient compartment will be extinguished when bulkhead doors, rear doors, or rear steps are opened unless the vehicle main light switch is in "SERVICE DRIVE" position.

#### B. **White Light Operation.**

(1) Place interior light switch (1) on electrical control panel (3) in "NORMAL" position. The blackout lights will illuminate.

· NBC filters do not protect against carbon monoxide poisoning. · NBC filters do not decontaminate or neutralize contamination, they only collect and contain it.

· NBC contaminated filters must be handled using adequate precaution (FM 3-5) and must be disposed of by trained personnel.

· After Nuclear, Biological, or Chemical (NBC) exposure of this vehicle, all air filters shall be handled with extreme caution. Unprotected personnel may experience injury or death if residual toxic agents or radioactive material are present. Servicing personnel will wear protective overgarments, mask, hood, and chemical protective gloves and boots. All contaminated air filters will be placed into double-lined plastic bags and moved immediately to a temporary segregation area away from the work site. If contaminated by radioactive dust, the Company NBC team will measure the radiation before removal. The NBC team will determine the extent of safety procedures required. The temporary segregation area will be marked with the appropriate NBC signs. Final disposal of contaminated air filters will be in accordance with local SOP.

· Failure to observe above warnings may result in injury or death.

#### A. General

(1) For operation in an NBC environment, M996, M996A1, M997, M997A1, and M997A2 ambulances are equipped with a collective NBC protection system known as a Gas-Particulate Filter Unit (GPFU). The GPFU forces filtered, temperature-controlled air to the facepiece of the M25 series protective mask or the M13 series patient protective mask, increasing NBC protection, easing breathing effort, and reducing stress and heat fatigue during extended periods of NBC operation.

(2) The GPFU system mounted in M996 and M996A1, M997, M997A1, and M997A2 ambulances include the following components:
· M1A1-19 precleaner (blower)/particulate filter unit · M18 gas filters (two per vehicle) · NBC control panel and wiring harness
· Five or seven individual NBC heaters
· PVC or flex tubing to connect filter precleaner/particulate filter and heaters.

#### B. Component Location And Identification.

(1) The precleaner/particulate filter unit (6) and the two gas filters (5) are located in the NBC stowage compartment above the driver's position. In the M997, M997A1, and M997A2 ambulances, entry to this compartment is gained by unlatching the two paddle locks (1) and securing the NBC access door (2) to the ceiling (3) with the door catch (4).

(3) The NBC heaters (6) supply heated air to protective mask facepieces

![281_image_0.png](281_image_0.png)

connected to the GPFU system. Five heaters are installed in the M996 and M996A1 ambulances; three in the patient compartment and two in the cab. Seven heaters are installed in the M997, M997A1, and M997A2 ambulances; five in the patient compartment and two in the cab. When the heater (6) is not in use, the protective cap (9) should be installed in the heater (6) outlet. The cap (9) is a oneway check valve allowing air to flow in only one direction, outward from the heater (6). This reduces the potential risk of NBC contamination to the vehicle's NBC system. The heater (6) is activated by turning the temperature control knob (8) clockwise and adjusting to the desired heat level. The indicator light (7)
will illuminate when the heater (6) is in operation
(4) The NBC control box (11) is mounted in the cab above and behind the passenger position. It houses the control switch (13) for the system and a fuse panel (12). A diagram (15) on the control box (11) shows heater location and identifies the fuse responsible for each heater circuit (16). Spare fuses are also present.

(5) To replace a NBC fuse (10), simply pull it straight out of the fuse

![281_image_1.png](281_image_1.png)

panel (12). Check fuse (10) for an open fuse element or a melted fuse link (14). If the fuse (10) is damaged, replace with a new fuse (10). All fuses in the NBC control box are 20 amp.

#### C. Nbc System Operation.

(1) Activate the collective NBC protection system by positioning the NBC
control switch (2) on the NBC control box (1) to the "ON" position. The M1A1-19 precleaner/particulate unit blower should engage.

(2) M25 series protective mask (10): remove protective cap (3) from heater outlet (4) and connect either the six or nine foot air hose (8) to canister coupling (9). Connect hose coupling (7) to the heater outlet (4).

(3) M13 series patient protective mask (11): mask the patient with the M13 series mask (11). Connect either the six or nine foot air hose (8) to adapter (13) and connect adapter (13) to protective mask facepiece (12). Remove protective cap (14) from the heater outlet (15) and connect hose coupling (7) to heater outlet (15).

(4) Turn heater control (6) to "WARMER" and adjust to desired heat level.

Indicator light (5) should illuminate when heater is on.

(5) To shut down the NBC system, use the following procedure:

Troubleshooting, table 3-1, contains instructions that will help the operator identify and correct simple vehicle malfunctions. The table also helps the operator identify major mechanical difficulties that must be referred to unit maintenance. The listing of possible malfunctions come under major vehicle headings. They are:
· Engine
· Heating system
· Transmission · Transfer case · Brakes
· Wheels and tires
· Steering · Winch · Special purpose bodies

#### 3-6. Troubleshooting Procedures

a. Table 3-1 lists the common malfunctions which you may find during the operation or maintenance of M998 series of vehicles or its components. You should perform the tests/inspections and corrective actions in the order listed.

b. This manual cannot list all malfunctions that may occur, nor all tests or inspections and corrective actions. If a malfunction is not listed or is not corrected by listed actions, notify your supervisor.

Entering water too fast will cause water to splash up over hood and into air intake. The engine may stop abruptly and will not crank. Do not continue starting efforts; damage to engine will result.

· Hydrostatic lock is caused by the entry of substantial amounts of water into the engine through the air intake system and subsequent contamination of the fuel system. Hydrostatic lock most frequently occurs during or just after fording. Water is forced into the air intake system, is drawn into the engine, and effectively "locks-up" the engine.

· Notify unit maintenance for further engine tests if you suspect hydrostatic lock.

# Appendix G Lubrication Instructions

G 1. SCOPE This appendix gives lubrication requirements for the M998 series vehicles which are the responsibility of the operator/crew. G-2. GENERAL LUBRICATION REQUIREMENTS
a. **Maintaining Lubricant Levels.** Lubricant levels must be checked as specified in the PMCS (Chapter 2, Section 2) and Table G-l, Lubrication. Steps must be taken to replenish and maintain lubricant levels.

WARNING
· Drycleaning solvent P-D-680 is TOXIC and flammable. Wear protective goggles and gloves, use only in well-ventilated area, avoid contact with skin, eyes, and clothes, and do not breathe vapors. Keep away from heat and flame. Never smoke when using solvent. The flashpoint for type I drycleaning solvent is 100°F (38°C), and for type II, is 138°F (50°C). Failure to do so may result in injury or death to personnel.

· If personnel become dizzy while using cleaning solvent, immediately get fresh air and medical help. If solvent contacts skin or clothes, flush with cold water. If solvent contacts eyes, immediately flush eyes with water and get medical attention.

b. **Cleaning Fittings Before Lubrication.** Clean parts with drycleaning solvent P-D-680 or equivalent.

Dry before lubricating. Dotted arrow points indicate lubrication on both sides of the equipment.

c. **Lubrication After Fording.** If fording operation occurs, lubricate all fittings below fording depth and check submerged gear boxes for presence of water.

d. **Lubrication After High-Pressure Washing**. After a thorough washing, lubricate all grease fittings and oil can points outside and underneath vehicle.

e. **Localized Views.** A reference to the appropriate localized view is given after most lubrication entries.

Localized views begin on page G-11.

#### G-1

## G-3. Lubrication Intervals

a. **Service Interval Under Normal Conditions.** Service intervals listed are for normal operation in moderate temperatures, humidity, and atmospheric conditions. Hard time intervals may be shortened if your lubricants are contaminated or if you are operating the equipment under adverse conditions, including longer-than-usual operating hours. Hard time intervals may be extended during periods of low activity, though adequate preservation precautions must be taken. Perform semi-annual service intervals every six months, or 3,000 miles (4,827 km), whichever comes first.

b. **Service Interval Under Unusual Conditions.** Increase frequency of lubricating service when operating under abnormal conditions such as high or low temperatures, prolonged high speed driving, or extended cross-country operations. Such operation can diminish lubricant's protective qualities. More frequent lubricating service intervals are necessary to maintain vehicle readiness when operating under abnormal conditions.

c. **Hard Time Intervals.** Intervals shown in this appendix are based on mileage and calendar times. An example of mileage and calendar interval is: 3/S, in which 3 stands for 3,000 mi (4,827 km), and S stands for semiannually (every six months). The lubrication for the vehicle is to be performed at whichever interval occurs first. For equipment under manufacturer's warranty, hard time oil service intervals shall be followed.

d. **Army Oil Analysis Program (AOAP).** HMMWV engines and transmissions are enrolled in the Army Oil Analysis Program (AOAP). The sampling interval for the engine is every six months or 3,000 miles (4,827 km) (or 100 hours if hour meter is installed) of operation. For the transmission, the sampling interval is every 12 months or 6,000 miles (9,654 km) (or 300 hours if hour meter is installed) of operation.

## G - 4 . L U B R I C Ation For Operation Under Extreme Temperat U R E S

a. **Changes in Lubricant Grades.** Lubricant grades change with weather conditions. Refer to Lubrication Table for lubricant grade changes.

b. **Arctic Conditions.** Refer to FM 9-207, Operation and Maintenance of Ordnance Materiel in cold Weather (0°F to -65°F) (-18°C to -54°C), or the Lubrication Table.

## G-5. Corrosion Control

Refer to para 2-4 for appropriate corrosion control procedures.

## Notes

#### 1. Oil Can Points.

Lubricate all oil can points every 3,000 mi (4,827 km), or semiannually, whichever occurs first. Use seasonal grade OE on hood hinges, tailgate hinges, door hinges, door handles, transfer case shift linkage, accelerator linkage, transmission shift linkage, heater control shutoff valve lever and pin, and heater control knob and plunger. Lubricate cargo shell door front paddle lock, rear wire handle lock and cargo shell door latches with PL-S, (M996, M996A1, M1025, M1025A1, M1025A2, M1026, M1026A1, M1036, M1043, M1043A1, M1043A2, M1044, M1044A1, M1045, M1045A1, M1045A2, M1046, and M1046A1 only).

#### 2. Winch Wire Rope. .Warning.

Wear leather gloves when handling winch wire rope. Do not handle wire rope with bare hands. Broken wires cause injury.

After each use, clean and lubricate winch wire rope. Clean entire wire rope with wire brush. Lubricate with new OE/HDO. Perform winch wire rope cleaning and lubrication every 3,000 mi (4,827 km) or semiannually, whichever occurs first, when wire rope is not used.

#### 3. Pintle.

Every 3,000 mi (4,827 km), or semiannually, whichever occurs first, clean pintle with wire bush and lubricate rear plate fitting with seasonal grade OE.

#### 4. Steering System. Caution

Do not over lubricate tie rod ends and upper and lower ball joints. One or two shots is adequate. Excessive lubrication will result in the boot rupturing. Observe the boot during lubrication: a seeping condition indicates adequate lubrication; expansion of the boot indicates over lubrication.

Lubricate front propeller shaft, steering column, U-joints, slip yokes, tie rods, upper and lower ball joints, radius rods, pitman arm, intermediate steering shafts, and idler arm with GAA every 3,000 mi (4,827 km), or semiannually, whichever comes first.

#### 5. Power Steering Reservoir. Caution

- Use Dexron® II or Dexron® III
for filling power steering reservoir. Failure to use Dexron® II or Dexron® III
will cause damage to power steering system.

- Do not overfill the power steering reservoir. Excessive fluid will cause damage to power steering system.

Check the fluid level in the power steering reservoir and adjust level as necessary. Level must be above "ADD" mark. Fluid does not require periodic changing.

| operating level is within the |      |
| crosshatch marks on the       |      |
| dipstick. Overfilling will    |      |
| result  in  damage            | to   |

- Use Dexron® II or Dexron®
III (3L80) or Dexron® III
(4L80-E) for filling transmission. Failure to use appropriate lubrication will cause damage to transmission.

Check and fill transmission to proper level weekly. Operate transmission through all operating ranges to fill cavities and fluid passages. With vehicle positioned on level ground, allow engine to idle, shift transmission to neutral, and apply parking brake. For vehicles with a park position, shift transmission to park. Check fluid level on dipstick. It should register within the crosshatch marks under the conditions stated above. On vehicles equipped for deep water fording, the dipstick has a seal which fits into the opening of the dipstick tube. The dipstick handle must be turned counterclockwise to be released before dipstick is withdrawn. Turn dipstick handle clockwise to seat after installing dipstick. Have fluid changed every 12,000 mi (19,308 km), or biennially, whichever occurs first.

#### 7. Crankcase Oil Level. Caution

- There are two marks on the dipstick: "FULL" and "ADD 1 QT." The quantity of oil required to raise the oil level from "ADD 1 QT" mark to "FULL" mark is 1 qt (0.9 L). Do not overfill crankcase. Overfilling will result in damage to engine.

- If oil level is above "FULL,"
it may be due to oil cooler drain back. Operate the engine for one minute, shut down, wait one minute, then recheck oil level.

- Oil is added to crankcase through fill tube which is located on top of engine.

Check crankcase oil level daily. Start engine and visually check for oil leaks at drain plug and oil filter. Stop engine and wait approximately one minute for oil to drain back into oil pan, then recheck oil level with dipstick. On vehicles equipped for deep water fording, the dipstick has a seal which fits into the opening of the dipstick tube. The dipstick handle must be turned counterclockwise to be released before dipstick is withdrawn. Turn handle clockwise to seat after installing dipstick. Have oil changed every 3,000 mi (4,827 km), or semiannually, whichever occurs first.
