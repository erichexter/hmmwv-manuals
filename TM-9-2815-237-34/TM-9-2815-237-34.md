# Warning Exhaust Gases Can Kill

Brain damage or death can result from heavy exposure. Precautions must be followed to ensure personnel safety when the engine is operated for any purpose.

1. DO NOT operate your vehicle engine in enclosed area. 2. BE ALERT at all times for exhaust odors. 3. BE ALERT for exhaust poisoning symptoms. They are:
- Headache - Dizziness - Sleepiness - Loss of muscular control 4. If YOU SEE another person with exhaust poisoning symptoms:
- Remove person from area - Expose to open air - Keep person warm - Do not permit person to move - Administer artificial respiration, if necessary* - Notify a medic
* For artificial respiration, refer to FM 21-11 5. BE AWARE, the field protective mask for nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) protection will not protect you from exhaust poisoning. THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST EXHAUST POISONING IS ADEQUATE VENTILATION.

# Warning Summary

- Always wear eyeshields when using compressed air. Failure to wear eyeshields may result in eye injury. - Compressed air used for cleaning purposes will not exceed 30 psi (207 kPa). Use only with effective chip guarding and personal protective equipment (goggles/shield, gloves, etc.).

- Do not use compressed air to dry bearings. Spinning a dry bearing with compressed air may cause injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- Improper cleaning methods and use of unauthorized cleaning solutions will injure personnel and damage equipment. See TM 9-247 for correct information.

- Drycleaning solvent is flammable and will not be used near an open flame. A fire extinguisher will be kept nearby when the solvent is used. Use only in well-ventilated places. Failure to do this may result in injury to personnel and/or damage to equipment.

- When steam cleaning, protective clothing must be used. Failure to use protective clothing may result in serous injury.

- Diesel fuel is highly flammable. Do not perform this procedure near fire, flame, or sparks. Severe injury or death may result.

- Cylinder block must be supported during removal and installation from engine stand. Failure to support cylinder block may cause injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- Crankshaft must be supported during removal and installation. Failure to support crankshaft may cause injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- Do not place hands or arms near nozzle during testing. Penetrating force of oil may cause serious injury or death.

- Direct personnel to stand clear during hoisting operation. Failure to do this may cause injury to personnel. - Gaskets installed on some 6.2L engines assembled prior to 1991 may contain asbestos. Gaskets should be removed with a scraper or putty knife and then disposed of IAW current directives. Inhalation of asbestos fibers can cause respiratory ailments.

# Chapter 2 Engine Maintenance

Section I. REPAIR PARTS, SPECIAL TOOLS, TEST, MEASUREMENT, AND
DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT (TMDE), AND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT

## 2-1. Common Tools And Equipment

Refer to Modified Table of Organization and Equipment (MTOE) for authorized common tools and equipment applicable to your unit.

## 2-2. Special Tools And Support Equipment

Special tools and support equipment are listed in Appendix E of this manual and illustrated in TM 9-2815237-34P.

2-3. TEST, MEASUREMENT, AND DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT (TMDE)
Calibrate all measuring and test equipment used to determine equipment conformance in accordance with TB 43-180.

 2-4. REPAIR PARTS
Repair parts are listed and illustrated in TM 9-2815-237-34P.

## Section Il. Service Upon **Receipt** 2-5. Engine Inspection

a. Inspect for any damage done to engine during its removal from the vehicle. Refer to TM 9-2320-280-34 for engine removal procedure.

b. Upon receipt of engine, ensure that all components are present and that no engine subassemblies have been removed. Refer to TM 9-2320-280-34 for engine dress after removal.

c. If the engine has been transferred to you from another DS/GS maintenance facility, check the equipment against the packing slip to see if the shipment is complete. Report all discrepancies in accordance with the instructions of DA Pam 738-750.

# Section Iii. Troubleshooting

## 2-6. General

Information in this section is for use of support maintenance personnel in conjunction with, and as a supplement to, troubleshooting procedures in TM 9-2320-280-20 and TM 9-2320-280-34.

## 2-7. Engine Troubleshooting

Operation of a deadlined engine without preliminary inspection will cause further damage.

Information to be used for troubleshooting the engine is contained in TM 9-2320-280-20 and TM 9-2320-280-34.

a. Excessive oil consumption is generally caused by leaky gaskets or loose line connections.

b. Always check the easiest and most obvious things first. This simple rule saves time and trouble. c. Double check before disassembly. The source of most engine problems can be traced to more than one part in a system. For example:
(1) Excessive fuel consumption may not be caused by the fuel pump alone. Instead, the trouble could be a clogged air cleaner, or a restricted exhaust passage causing severe back pressure.

(2) Engines very often are disassembled in search of a complaint and the real evidence of the problem is destroyed. Check again to be sure an easier solution to the problem has not been overlooked.

d. Before correcting a problem, diagnose the cause of the problem. Do not allow the same failure to occur again.

## 2-9. Cleaning

a. General Instructions. Cleaning procedures will be the same for the majority of parts and components which make up engine subassemblies. General cleaning procedures are detailed in "b" through "i".

b. The Importance of Cleaning. Great care and effort are required in all cleaning operations. The presence of dirt and foreign material is a constant threat to satisfactory engine operation and maintenance.

The following will apply to all cleaning operations:
(1) Hands must be kept free of any accumulation of grease which can collect dust and grit. (2) Clean all parts before inspection, after repair, and before assembly. (3) After cleaning, all parts must be covered or wrapped in plastic or paper to protect them from dust and/or dirt.

### Warning

Compressed air used for cleaning purposes will not exceed 30 psi (207 kPa). Use only with effective chip guarding and personal protective equipment (goggles/shield, gloves, etc.).

c. External Engine Cleaning. All electrical equipment and other parts that could be damaged by steam cleaning or moisture must be removed, and all openings covered before cleaning. Dry with compressed air.

d. Disassembled Parts Cleaning. Place all disassembled parts in wire baskets for cleaning.

(1) Dry and cover all cleaned parts. (2) Place on or in "racks" and hold for inspection or repair. (3) All parts subject to rusting must be lightly oiled and wrapped.

(4) Keep all related parts and components together. Do not mix parts.

#### Warning

Improper cleaning methods and use of unauthorized cleaning solutions will injure personnel and damage equipment. See TM 9-247 for correct information.

#### E. Castings.

(1) Clean inner and outer surfaces of castings and all areas subject to grease and oil with cleaning solvents. Refer to TM 9-247.

(2) Use a stiff brush to remove sludge and gum deposits. (3) Use compressed air to blow out all tapped capscrew holes and dry castings after cleaning.

f. Oil Passages. Particular attention must be given to all oil passages in castings and machined parts.

Oil passages must be clean and free of any obstructions.

(1) Clean passages with wire probes to breakup any sludge or gum deposits. (2) Wash passages by flushing with solvents. See TM 9-247, (3) Dry passages with compressed air.

Do not allow drycleaning solvents to come in contact with seals, cables, or flexible hoses. These cleaners cause leather, rubber, and synthetic materials to dry out, rot, and lose pliability making them unserviceable.

g. Nonmetallic Parts. Clean hoses and other nonmetallic parts with soap and water. h. Bearings.

### Warning

Do not use compressed air to dry bearings. Spinning a dry bearing with compressed air may cause injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

(1) Bearings require special cleaning. After removing surface oil and gum deposits, place bearings in hot oil, 140°F (60•C), to loosen congealed oil and grease. Wipe bearings dry with a Iint-free cloth; do not use compressed air.

(2) See TM 9-214 for information and care of bearings.

### I. Electrical Components.

(1) Clean electrical components with clean cloth dampened with drycleaning solvent. Care must be taken not to damage protective insulation.

### Warning

Compressed air used for cleaning purposes will not exceed 30 psi
(207 kPa). Use only with effective chip guarding and personaI protective equipment (goggles/shield, gloves, etc.).

### 2-11. Repair

a. General Instructions. Repair of most parts and components is limited to general procedures outlined in applicable maintenance instructions and the following detailed procedures "b" through "h".

CAUTION
Repaired items must be thoroughly cleaned to remove metal chips and abrasives to prevent them from entering working parts of the engine.

#### B. Castings.

(1) All cracked castings will be replaced. (2) Only minor repairs to machined surfaces, flanges, and gasket mating surfaces are permitted.

Remove minor nicks, burrs, and/or scratches with:
(a) Fine mill file. (b) Abrasive crocus cloth dipped in cleaning solvent. (c) Lapping across a surface plate. (d) Remachining of machined surfaces to repair damage, warpage, or uneven surfaces is not permitted. Replace castings.

(3) Repair damaged threaded pipe plug and/or capscrew holes with a thread tap or repair oversize holes with threaded inserts.

### C. Bearings. See Tm 9-214.

d. Studs. Replace all bent and stretched studs. Repair minor thread damage with a thread restorer file.

Replace studs having stripped or damaged threads as outlined below:
(1) Remove, using a stud remover. Back studs out slowly to avoid heat buildup and seizure which can cause stud to break off.

(2) If studs break off too short to use with a stud remover, use extractor to remove. (3) Replacement studs have a special coating and must have a small amount of antiseize compound
(Appendix B, Item 3) applied on threads before stud is installed. Install replacement stud slowly to prevent heat buildup and snapping off.

e. Gears.

(1) Remove gears using pullers, as required. (2) Use the same methods described in paragraph 2-11.b.(2) for castings tO remove minor nicks, burrs, or scratches on gear teeth.

(3) If keyways are worn or enlarged, replace gear.

f. **Bushings and BushingType Bearings.** When bushings and bushing-type bearings seize to a shaft and spin in the bore, the associated part must also be inspected and replaced, as required.

g. Oil Seals.

(1) Remove oil seals, being careful not to damage casting or adapter bore.

(2) Always install new seal in bore using proper seal replacing tool.

h. Cylinder Block or Cylinder Head. Repair of cylinder block and cylinder head is limited to procedures outlined in paragraphs 2-16 and 2-21. Cylinder block or cylinder head must be replaced if measurements are outside tolerance limits listed in table 2-2 or table 2-3.

## 2-12. Assembly

a. Cleanliness is essential in all component assembly operations. Dirt and dust, even in minute quantities, are abrasive. Parts must be cleaned as specified, and kept clean. Wrap or cover parts and components when assembly procedures are not immediately completed.

b. Coat all bearings and contact surfaces with engine oil (MIL-L-2104) to ensure lubrication of parts during initial operation after repair.

c. Use new gaskets and preformed packings during assembly of all components.

#### Not E

If cylinder bores are found to have less than 0.005 in. (0.127 mm) wear, taper, or out-of-round, they may be honed oversize (refer to para. 2-16.d.1) and fitted with "Hi-Limit" standard size pistons.

8. Using cylinder bore gauge, measure all cylinder bores (2) for taper. Measurements must be taken at point "A" (4) at top and bottom of cylinder bore (2). If any cylinder exceeds specifications (table 2-2 or 2-3) by 0.005 in. (0.127 mm) or more, repair cylinder or replace engine.

9. Using cylinder bore gauge, measure all cylinder bores (2) for out-of-round. Measurement must be taken at point "A" (4) and point "B" (3) at top and bottom of cylinder bore (2). If any cylinder exceeds specifications (table 2-2 or 2-3) by 0.005 in. (0.127 mm) or more, repair cylinder or replace engine.

10. Using cylinder bore gauge, measure all cylinder bores (2) for bore diameter. Measurement must be taken at point "A" (4) 2-1/2 in. (64 mm) from top of cylinder bore (2). If any cylinder exceeds specifications (table 2-2 or 2-3) by 0.005 in. (0.127 mm) or more, repair cylinder or replace engine.

d. Repair

#### Not E

If cylinder block inspection indicated that the cylinder block was suitable for continued use except for out-of-round, taper, or minor nicks or scratches, it can be conditioned by honing or boring.

#### 1. Boring.

a. Before using any type of boring bar, the top of the cylinder block should be filed off to remove any dirt or burrs. This is very important. If not checked, the boring bar may be tilted, which would result in the rebored cylinder wall not being at right angles to the crankshaft.

b. Measure piston diameter of the piston to be used at the skirt across the center line of the piston pin. c. Using a boring bar, bore the cylinder to the same diameter as the piston. Hone the cylinder to get proper piston-to-bore clearance.

d. Repeat steps b. and c. for remaining cylinders.

2. Honing.

a. Using cylinder bore gauge, measure cylinder bore (2) for cylinder bore diameter. Measurement must be taken at point "A" (4) 2-1/2 in. (64 mm) from top of cylinder bore (2).

b. Measure "piston diameter" of piston (5) removed from corresponding cylinder using a micrometer at piston skirt (7) across center line of piston pin (6).

c. Subtract "piston diameter" from "cylinder bore diameter" to determine "piston-to-bore clearance".

d. Repeat steps a. through c. for remaining cylinder bores and pistons.

#### Not E

- Cylinders can be conditioned with a hone or boring bar and fitted with a standard "Hi-Limit" piston or oversized piston, if necessary.

- If a cylinder is pitted or worn such that it cannot be honed and fitted with a "Hi-Limit" piston or oversized piston, a cylinder sleeve may be used to repair the engine block.

- 6.5L engines do not have "Hi-Limit" pistons.

e. If all cylinder bores (2) have proper "piston-to-bore clearance" of 0.004-0.005 in. (0.102-0.127 mm)
or if proper "piston-to-bore clearance" may be obtained using a standard "Hi-Limit" piston or oversized piston, go to step f. If not, engine may be repaired using a cylinder sleeve (para. 2-16.d.2).

# 2 - 1 6 . Cylinder Block Repair (Cont'D)

#### Not E

Occasionally during the honing operation, cylinder bore should be thoroughly cleaned, and the piston-to-bore clearance checked for correct fit.

f. Using cylinder hone, refinish cylinder bore (2). Hone should be moved up and down at sufficient speed to obtain very fine uniform surface finish marks, in a cross-hatch pattern of approximately 45° to 65° included angle. The finish marks should be clean, not sharp, and free from imbedded particles and torn or folded material.

g. If a "Hi-Limit" piston or oversized piston (5) was fitted to a cylinder bore (2), permanently mark the piston (5) for the cylinder bore (2) to which it has been fitted.

h. Repeat steps f. and g. for remaining cylinder bores. i. Thoroughly clean the cylinder block (1) with hot water and detergent. Scrub cylinder bores (2)

![63_image_0.png](63_image_0.png)

with a stiff brush and rinse thoroughly with hot water. The cylinder bores (2) should be coated with OE/HDO and wiped with a clean, dry cloth.

# 2 - 1 6 . Cylinder Block Repair (Cont'D)

2. Installation of cylinder sleeves.

Do not use cylinder sleeves to repair a cracked engine block.

Cylinders that still show damage or wear after being honed to a maximum oversize of 0.030 in. (0.762 mm) will require sleeves.

a. Identify cylinders that require sleeves. b. Using micrometer, measure outside diameter of cylinder sleeve (1).

- Before using any type of boring bar, the top of the cylinder block should be filed off to remove any dirt or burrs. This is very important. If not checked, the boring bar may be tilted, which would result in the rebored cylinder wall not being at right angle to crankshaft.

Set the throttle lever in correct low idle position prior to calibration using throttle lever gauge. The low idle screw must beat 34 ± 2 degrees as measured between vertical centerline of throttle shaft bushing bore and throttle connection stud.

Flush the pump with calibrating oil to remove metal chips and possible contamination. Before mounting the pump on the test stand, check the drive shaft for freedom of rotation in the housing. Pump should be mounted securely in the appropriate adapter, and the intermediate coupling checked for freedom of movement.

Connect supply and return lines securely.

Install high pressure injection lines. Use copper gaskets or steel washers where required. Leave fuel line connections at the pump and nozzles loose.

Apply 17.6 V to electric shutoff solenoid and operate pump at 1000 rpm (WOT) for 10 minutes to bring to operating temperature and clear air from system. Tighten all connections securely. Check connections for leaks while operating.

Set transfer pump pressure at 2000 rpm (WOT) for 60-62 psi (414-427 kPa); test stand boost should be set at 5 ± 0.5 psi (34.5 ± 3.4 kPa).

Set return oil flow to 225-375 cc/minute at 2000 rpm (WOT).

Measure housing pressure: (a) Check housing pressure at 650 rpm, with throttle shaft in low idle position, pressure should be 8-12 psi (55-83 kPa).

(b) Energize housing pressure cold advance solenoid with 17.6 V. Housing pressure should be 0-1 psi (0-7 kPa).

With governor cover removed and throttle shaft in low idle position, set min-max governor assembly for 7-9 mm3/stroke at 650 rpm (fuel reading with cover installed).

At 650 rpm, adjust low idle screw for 13-15 mm3/stroke for the remainder of the setting and checking procedures. During and at the completion of all settings, ensure face cam to throttle shaft end play measures 0.004-0.006-in. (0.10-0.15 mm) between throttle shaft spacer and housing.

At 3400 rpm (WOT), rotate face cam to its maximum lift position in contact with the cam roller.

Adjust trimmer screw at 3400 rpm (WOT), for 4.0 degrees cam advance and set fuel delivery to 50-51 mm3/troke.

Set guide stud for 35.5-37.5 mm3/stroke at 3650 rpm (WOT). Tighten guide stud nut to 80-90 lb-in.

(9-10 N•m) and check dimension from top of nut to top of guide stud for 0.400-in. (10.2 mm) maximum.

Set throttle for 21.5-23.5 mm3/stroke at 3200 rpm and rotate face cam to obtain 5.10 degrees cam advance. Tighten face cam screw to 28-30 lb-in. (3 N•m) and check face cam retention.

(a) Put 0.005-in. (0.127 mm) feeler gauge between throttle shaft mylar washer and housing boss. (b) Put throttle shaft in idle position. Squeeze throttle shaft and face cam tightly toward each other and rotate face cam as lower roller rests approximately in middle at low idle step.

Tighten screw to 30 lb-in. (3 N•m) with torx bit and remove feeler gauge.

Set total throttle travel. With throttle in low idle position, align zero degree mark on protractor with center of rib on rocker lever. Move throttle to WOT and adjust maximum travel screw to 75-84 degrees.

# 2-41. Engine Assembly From Subassemblies (Cont'D)

- During assembly operations, it is important to closely inspect each unit to make sure nothing has been overlooked during inspection and repair.

Plugs should be checked for tightness, parts kept clean, openings covered, and machined surfaces protected. Application of lubricant should be performed from covered containers.

- Work area should be clean, well-ventilated, and free of blowing dirt and dust.

- In some cases, flanged head fasteners may be present instead of standard fasteners and washers. In all cases, washers should be used when replacing a flanged head fastener with a standard fastener.

- For general assembly instructions, refer to para. 2-12.

- Assembly procedures for pre-1990, 1990 and above 6.2L and 6.5L
engines are basically the same. Any differences in procedures are noted. Some replacement parts are different. Refer to para. 1-10 to determine engine model before ordering replacement parts.

#### A. Crankshaft And Main Bearings Note

- Measure outside diameter of crankshaft main bearing journals to determine what thickness main bearings to install.

- Main bearings are of the precision insert type and do not utilize shims for adjustment. If clearances are found to be excessive, a new bearing, both upper and lower halves, will be required. Service bearings are available in standard size and undersize.

- Selective fitting of both rod and main bearing inserts is necessary in production in order to obtain close tolerances. For this reason you may find one-half of a standard insert with one half of a 0.001 in. (0.025 mm) undersize insert, which will decrease the clearance 0.0005 in. (0.013 mm) from using a full standard bearing.

1. Remove all capscrews (1) and (2) and bearing caps (3) and install upper halves of main bearings (7)
in cylinder block (6).

2. Install lower halves of main bearings (4) in bearing caps (3).

Crankshaft must be supported during removal and installation. Failure to support crankshaft may cause injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

3. Install crankshaft (8) in cylinder block (6).

The gaging plastic shall be positioned the full width of the bearing and centered on the bearing journal when the bearing cap is installed.

4. Position gauging plastic on bearing journal (5) the full width of the bearing (4) and parallel to the center line of the crankshaft (8).

# 2 - 4 1 . Engine Assembly From Subassemblies (Cont'D)

Bearing caps are numbered 1 through 5 and must be installed in correct order, starting with number 1 at front of cylinder block. Arrow on bearing cap must point forward or engine damage will result.

5. Install bearing cap (3) on cylinder block (6) with two long capscrews (1) and short capscrews (2).

Tighten capscrews (1) and (2) finger tight.

6. Tighten all long capscrews (1) to 110 lb-ft (149 N•m). Tighten all short capscrews (2) to 100 lb-ft 
(136 N•m).

7. Remove two long capscrews (1), short capscrews (2), and bearing cap (3) from cylinder block (6). 8. On edge of envelope (9) there is a scale which is graduated in thousandths of an inch. Without removing gauging plastic, measure its thickness at the widest point with scale on envelope (9).

9. If gauging plastic tapers toward the middle or ends, there is a difference in clearance indicating taper, low spot, or irregularity of bearing or crankshaft journal. If gauging plastic indicates more than 0.001 in. (0.025 mm) taper, measure crankshaft journal with micrometer (para. 2-17).

#### Not E

If unable to obtain the proper crankshaft journal clearance, it is acceptable to use a standard bearing with a 0.0005 in. (0.013 mm) or 0.001 in. (0.025 mm) undersize bearing to produce clearance. If unable to produce proper clearance, replace crankshaft.

10. If the measurement is within the specifications of 0.002-0.004 in. (0.051-0.102 mm), go to step 11.

![200_image_0.png](200_image_0.png)

If measurement is not within specifications, a 0.0005 in. (0.013 mm) or 0.001 in. (0.025 mm) undersize bearing may produce proper bearing clearance. Replace bearings and repeat steps 4 through 10.

11. Repeat steps 4 through 10 for remaining main bearings.

# 2-41. Engine Assembly From Subassemblies (Cont'D)

#### Warning

Crankshaft must be supported during removal and installation. Failure to support crankshaft may cause injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

Bearing caps are numbered one through five and must be installed in correct order, starting with number one at front of cylinder block. Arrow on bearing cap must point forward or engine damage will result.

12. After all main bearing clearances have been set, remove crankshaft (7) and gauging plastic and apply OE/HDO to all main bearings. Install crankshaft (7), all bearing caps (1), (2), and (3), long capscrews (4) and short capscrews (5). Tighten long capscrews (4) and short capscrews (5) to 12 lb-ft (16 N•m).

13. Tap crankshaft (7) rearward, then frontward; this will align main bearing thrust surfaces (6).

Tighten long capscrews (4) and short capscrews (5) to 40 lb-ft (54 N•m).

14. Tighten all long capscrews (4) to 110 lb-ft (149 N•m). Tighten all short capscrews (5) to 100 lb-ft

- Perform steps 17 through 24 for 6.2L engines ONLY when using a 2-piece nylon rope type rear main seal.

- Perform steps 17 and 21 through 24 when using a 2-piece rubber rear main seal.

23. Install number three bearing cap (3), two long capscrews (4), and short capscrews (5). Tighten capscrews (4) and (5) to 12 lb-ft (16 N•m).

24. Tap crankshaft (7) rearward, then frontward; this will align main bearing thrust surfaces (6).

Tighten capscrews (4) and (5) on number three bearing cap (3) to 40 lb-ft (54 N•m).

Immediately install rear main bearing cap after application of sealant.

25. Apply thin film of sealer to rear main bearing cap (1) mating surface. Keep sealer off bearing and oil seal (9) (installed on 6.2L engines).

26. Install rear main bearing cap (1) on cylinder block (8) with long capscrews (4), and short capscrews (5). Tighten capscrews (4) and (5) to 40 lb-ft (54 N•m).

17. Remove long capscrews (4), short capscrews (5), bearing caps (1), (2), and (3), and crankshaft (7)
from cylinder block (8).

18. Apply adhesive to seal groove in rear main bearing cap (1) and cylinder block (8). 19. Install rear main oil seal (9) into cylinder block (8) and rear main bearing cap (1) using seal installer. 20. Cut excess oil seal (9) off flush with bearing cap (1) and cylinder block (8) mounting surface. 21. Repeat steps 4 through 10 to ensure rear oil seal (9) did not affect rear main bearing clearance.

# Appendix F Torque Limits

#### F-1 General

This section provides general torque limits for screws used on the M998 series vehicles. Special torque limits are indicated in the maintenance procedures for applicable components. The general torque limits given in this appendix shall be used when specific torque limits are not indicated in the maintenance procedure. Unless otherwise specified, standard torque tolerance shall be ± 10 percent. These general torque limits cannot be applied to screws that retain rubber components. The rubber components will be damaged before the correct torque limit is reached. If a special torque limit is not given in the maintenance instructions, tighten the screw or nut until it touches the metal bracket, then tighten it one more turn.

## F-2. Torque Limits

Table F-1 lists dry torque limits. Dry torque limits are used on screws that do not have lubricants applied to the threads. Table F-2 lists wet torque limits. Wet torque limits are used on screws that have high pressure lubricants applied to the threads.

F-3. HOW TO USE TORQUE TABLE

![256_image_0.png](256_image_0.png)

a. Measure the diameter of the screw

![256_image_2.png](256_image_2.png)

you are installing.

b. Count the number of threads per inch.

c. Under the heading SIZE, look down the left-hand column until you find the diameter of the screw you are installing (there will usually be two lines beginning with the same size).

d. In the second column under SIZE, find the number of threads per inch that matches the number of threads you counted in step b.

CAPSCREW HEAD MARKINGS
Manufacturer's marks may vary.

![256_image_1.png](256_image_1.png) These are all SAE Grade 5
(3-line).

e. lb find the grade of screw you are installing, match he markings on the head to the correct picture of CAPSCREW HEAD MARKINGS on the torque table.

f. Look down the column under the picture you found in step e. until you find the torque limit (in lb-ft or N•m) for the diameter and threads per inch of the screw you are installing.
