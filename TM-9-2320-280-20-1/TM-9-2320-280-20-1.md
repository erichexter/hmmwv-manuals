# Warning

# Exhaust Gases Can Kill

Brain damage or death can result from heavy exposure. Precautions must be followed to ensure crew safety when the personnel heater, main, or auxiliary engine of any vehicle is operated for any purpose.

1. Do not operate your vehicle engine in enclosed areas. 2. Do not idle vehicle engine with vehicle windows closed. 3. Be alert at all times for exhaust odors. 4. Be alert for exhaust poisoning symptoms. they are:
- Headache - Dizziness - Sleepiness - Loss of muscular control 5. If you see another person with exhaust poisoning symptoms:
- Remove person from area - Expose to open air - Keep person warm - Do not permit physical exercise - Administer artificial respiration, if necessary* - Notify a medic
*For artificial respiration, refer to FM 21-11.

6. BE AWARE, the field protective mask for nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) protection will not protect you from carbon monoxide poisoning. THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST EXHAUST POISONING IS ADEQUATE VENTILATION.

# Warning Summary **(Cont'D)**

- Drycleaning solvent is flammable and will not be used near an open flame. A fire extinguisher will be kept nearby when the solvent is used. Use only in well-ventilated places. Failure to do this may result in injury to personnel and/or damage to equipment.

- Compressed air used for cleaning purposes will not exceed 30 psi (207 kPa). Use only with effective chip guarding and personal protective equipment (goggles/shield, gloves, etc.).

- Diesel fuel is highly flammable. Do not perform any procedure near fire, flames, or sparks. Severe injury or death will result.

- Do not touch hot exhaust system components with bare hands. Severe injury will result. - Do not remove surge tank filler cap before releasing internal pressure when engine temperature is above 190°F (88°C). Steam or hot coolant under pressure will cause injury.

- Do not drain oil when engine is hot. Severe injury to personnel will result. - Always wear eye protection when bleeding brakes. Failure to do this may cause injury if brake fluid comes in contact with eyes.

- Do not perform battery system checks or inspections while smoking or near fire, flames, or sparks.

Batteries may explode causing damage to vehicle, injury, or death to personnel.

- Remove all jewelry such as rings, dog tags, bracelets, etc. If jewelry or disconnected battery ground cable contacts battery terminal, a direct short will result, causing injury to personnel, or damage to equipment.

- Use caution when testing thermostat. Hot water will cause burns. - Negative battery cable must be disconnected before disconnecting any harness from protective control box, or serious injury to personnel or damage to equipment will result.

- Keep hands and arms away from fan blade and drivebelts while engine is running, or serious injury may result.

- Battery acid (electrolyte) is extremely harmful. Always wear safety goggles and rubber gloves, and do not smoke when performing maintenance on batteries. Injury will result if acid contacts eyes or skin.

- When removing battery cable clamps, disconnect ground cable first. Ensure all switches are in OFF position before disconnecting ground cable. Do not allow tools to come in contact with vehicle when disconnecting cable clamps. A direct short can result, causing instant heating of tools, tool damage, battery damage, or battery explosion.

- Allow transmission/transfer case to cool before performing maintenance. Failure to do this may cause injury.

- Always apply parking brake and chock opposite wheel before removing wheel. Avoid removing wheel when vehicle is on sloping terrain. Injury to personnel or damage to equipment may result.

- Gloves must be worn whenever handling winch cable. Severe injury may result. - Opening one end of cargo door without ensuring opposite end is securely closed will cause both ends to open simultaneously, resulting in injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- Direct all personnel to stand clear during engine hoisting operations. Failure to do this may cause injury to personnel.

- Hydraulic jacks are used for raising and lowering, and are not used to support vehicle. Never work under vehicle unless wheels are blocked and it is properly supported. Injury or damage to equipment may result if vehicle suddenly shifts or moves.

- Remove only the inner group of nuts when removing a wheel from the vehicle. Removing the outer nuts which hold the rim together while the assembly is inflated could result in serious injury or death.

# Warning Summary **(Cont'D)**

- In all disassembly of the wheel assembly operations, ensure the tire is totally deflated before removing wheel nuts. Failure to follow proper safety precautions could cause serious injury or death.

- Never inflate a wheel assembly with the wheel locknuts removed in an attempt to separate inner and outer rim halves. The assembly will separate under pressure resulting in serious injury or death.

- Never use wheel assemblies with studs which are damaged, loose, or have damaged threads. Damaged studs can cause improper assembly, which could cause individual fasteners to fail. Any of these situations could cause serious injury or death.

- Never use tubes in wheel assemblies. Use of a tube defeats built-in safety features, and could allow the wheel to come apart under pressure, resulting in serious injury or death.

- Use only replacement parts specified in TM 9-2320-280-24P. Wheels assembled with components which do not meet specifications could cause the assembly to separate under pressure, resulting in serious injury or death.

- Never inflate a wheel assembly without having checked wheel locknut torques to ensure to wheel locknuts are tightened to specifications. An assembly with improperly tightened locknuts could separate under pressure resulting in serious injury or death.

- Always use a tire inflation cage for inflation purposes. Stand on one side of cage, during inflation, never directly in front. Keep hands out of the cage during inflation. Inflate assembly to recommended pressure, using a clip-on air chuck. Do not exceed 30 psi (207 kPa) cold bias tire inflation pressure or 50 psi (344 kPa) cold radial tire inflation pressure. Failure to follow these instructions may result in serious injury or death.

- Never mix radial tires and bias ply tires on the same vehicle. Injury to personnel or damage to equipment may result.

- Rear steps must be raised before disconnecting retractor lever from rear steps. Failure to do this may cause injury to personnel and damage to equipment.

- NBC contaminated filters must be handled and disposed of only by authorized and trained personnel.

The unit commander or senior officer in charge of maintenance personnel must ensure that prescribed protective clothing (FM 3-4) is used, and prescribed safety measures and decontamination procedures (FM 3-5) are followed. The local unit SOP is responsible for final disposal of contaminated air filters. Failure to do this may cause severe injury to personnel.

- Seatbelts are to be replaced as a set. Failure to do this may cause injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

- The Department of Transportation requires 105 mm cannon ammunition to be in wooden boxes when transporting ammunition on public highways, by fixed wing aircraft, rail, or ship. Movement of cannon ammunition in fiber containers (inner pack) in the HMMWV ammunition rack is restricted to other than public highways.

Mandatory replacement parts (appendix G)
A typical example of how to use this manual is provided on the following pages.

USING YOUR MANUAL AN EXAMPLE
a. TASK: The operator of an M998 series

![24_image_0.png](24_image_0.png)

vehicle has complained that his TOW carrier uses too much engine oil. The vehicle has been assigned to you for repair.

### B. Troubleshooting Steps:

1. Look at the cover of this manual. You'll see chapter titles listed from top to bottom on the right-hand side.

2. Look at the right edge of the manual. On some of the pages you'll see black bars
(bleed-to-edge indicators) that are alined with the chapter bars on the cover. These are the locations of the chapters in the text.

3. Look for "SERVICE AND TROUBLESHOOTING INSTRUCTIONS" in the chapter list on the cover.

This is where the troubleshooting information is located.

4. Turn to those pages with the edge indicator matching the black bar for service and troubleshooting instructions. Page numbers are also listed next to chapter titles.

5. Chapter 2 is divided into four sections:
 Section I - Repair Parts, Special Tools, TMDE, and Support Equipment Ž Section II - Service Upon Receipt Ž Section III - PMCS Ž Section IV - Electrical/Mechanical Systems Troubleshooting vi 6. Turn to section IV, "ELECTRICAL/

![25_image_0.png](25_image_0.png)

MECHANICAL SYSTEMS TROUBLE- SHOOTING (page 2-30).

This troubleshooting section is systemoriented and is broken down into five top level tests and twenty-one system level tests.

7.

![25_image_1.png](25_image_1.png)

One of the first pages of this section is the "ELECTRICAL/MECHANICAL SYSTEM TROUBLESHOOTING" (turn to page 2-31)
8.

Look down the list of symptoms until you find
"ENGINE LUBRICATION TESTS". In that paragraph you will find the diagnostic flow chart that the vehicle operator can pick the test as "OIL LEAKS OR ENGINE PROBLEMS".

9.

Turn to the test indicated.

On page 2-188, steps relating to

![26_image_0.png](26_image_0.png) resolving the problem of excessive oil loss are listed. Read the diagnostic flow chart until you find "OIL LEAKS OR ENGINE PROBLEMS". The tests listed are shown in the example page to the right of this text.

10.

In accordance with Test 1, you checked the oil level and filter for leaks. The oil level and filter appears normal and you move on to Test 2.

11.

In Test 2, you begin a methodical check of the engine lubricating system. You discover a leak in the oil cooler assembly adjacent to one of the mounting brackets. One of the welds has cracked, allowing a class III leak from a small area of the cooling fins. The oil cooler assembly must be repaired or replaced.

12.

At this point, the engine lubrication diagnostic flow chart would direct you to a specific detailed procedure to solve the problem. However, the engine lubricating system is complex and you must now refer to the table of contents to locate the proper task paragraph.

13.

NOTE: Before attempting to repair or replace the oil cooler assembly, as a Unit mechanic, you must:
a. Determine the maintenance responsibility of repair or replacement of the component. b. If the task is at your echelon of maintenance responsibility, you must identify the tools needed and the replacement parts required.

Refer to the Maintenance Allocation Chart - MAC (appendix B) to determine not only the maintenance responsibility of the item, but also to obtain an estimate of the time required to perform the task, tools needed, and any special notes/requirements necessary.

Refer to TM 9-2320-280-24P, Unit Maintenance Repair Parts and Special Tools List for M998 Series Vehicles, for requisition data concerning replacement parts for this task.

![27_image_0.png](27_image_0.png)

c. OIL COOLER ASSEMBLY REPLACEMENT. After reporting the results of your troubleshooting efforts to your supervisor, he decides that the most expedient means of returning the vehicle to service would be to replace the oil cooler assembly.

Turn to the "TABLE OF CONTENTS" and find the chapter dealing with the engine. You find it as "CHAPTER 3, ENGINE SYSTEMS
MAINTENANCE". Furthermore, you note that the chapter is divided into five sections; you are interested in "Section I. Lubrication System Maintenance".

1.

2. Turn to chapter 3, section I on page 3-1. Here

![27_image_1.png](27_image_1.png)

you find the "Lubrication System Maintenance Task Summary". Read down the list of tasks until you find the one that will correct your maintenance problem. For our example, you find it as task 3-8 "Engine and Transmission Oil Cooler Assembly Maintenance". Turn to page 3-12.

![28_image_0.png](28_image_0.png)

![28_image_1.png](28_image_1.png)

3. On page 3-12 you find paragraph 3-8, the detailed procedure for replacing the oil cooler assembly.

d. DETAILED MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. Detailed maintenance procedures include everything you must do to accomplish a basic maintenance task. Unless otherwise stated, general mechanic's automotive tool kit will be used for maintenance of this vehicle.

1. Before beginning the maintenance task, look through the procedure. You must familiarize yourself with the entire maintenance procedure of para. 3-8: "Engine and Transmission Oil Cooler Assembly Maintenance". The task includes "a. Removal" "b. Installation" and "c. Cleaning and Inspection".

2. The ten basic headings listed under "INITIAL SETUP" outline task conditions, materials, special tools, manpower requirements, and special conditions. The headings are:
Applicable Models: Any models that require a particular maintenance task. If a maintenance task covers all models, then this heading will not be used. Test Equipment: Test equipment needed to complete a task. If test equipment is not required, this heading will not be used. Tools These are common tools and general mechanic tool sets required to perform maintenance tasks. These common tools should be on hand to properly perform the task. Torque wrenches are required for many tasks; the proper torque wrench should be available to tighten mounting hardware.

Special Tools: Those special tools needed to complete a maintenance task. If no special tools are needed, this heading will not be used.

If you don't have one of these special tools, requisition it (before starting the task) using the data supplied in TM 9-2320-280-24P, the repair parts and special tools list for this level of maintenance.

Special tools are located in section III.

Materials/Parts: This heading lists only mandatory replacement materials or parts (gaskets, O-
rings, sealant, etc.). To replace other unserviceable parts, refer to TM 9-2320-280-24P for requisition data. If no mandatory replacement materials/parts are required, this heading will not be used.

Personnel Required: The number of personnel needed to perform a task. If only one mechanic is needed, this heading will not be used.

NOTE
If you think that you need more help to adequately or safely complete a task, perhaps as the result of unusual conditions, etc.,
alert your supervisor and ask for help.

Manual References: Those TMs needed to complete the task.

Equipment Condition: Notes the conditions that must exist before starting the task. If none are required, this heading will not be used. For oil cooler assembly replacement, the left-hand engine splash shield should be removed before we can start the task. If not already done, follow the procedure for splash shield removal in para. 10-17, before proceeding with this task.

General Safety Instructions: Summarizes all safety warnings for the maintenance task. If none are required, this heading will not be used.

3. A step by step maintenance procedure follows the "INITIAL SETUP" and gives detailed instructions for the procedure. These instructions give the part's general location and name and action performed. In the example, oil cooler assembly replacement -a. Removal, step 1 is "Disconnect engine oil cooler supply and return lines (7) from engine oil cooler ports (9)". Note that the numbers in parenthesis correspond to the part's callout number in the accompanying illustration.

### Note

Warnings, cautions, and notes provide supplemental information:
Warnings : Indicate conditions, practices, or procedures which must be observed to avoid personnel injury, loss of life, loss of life, or long-term health hazard.

Cautions: Indicate condition, practices, or procedures which must be observed to avoid damage to equipment or destruction of equipment.

Notes: Include essential information of special importance, interest, or aid in job performance which should be remembered and would be otherwise difficult to find or incorporate into the text.

4. At the end of a procedure, "FOLLOW-ON TASKS" will list those additional tasks that must be performed to complete the procedure. The Follow-On Tasks for oil cooler assembly replacement are:
Ž Fill oil to proper level (TM 9-2320-280-10). Ž Install left-hand splash shield (para. 10-17).

Ž Start engine (TM 9-2320-280-10) and check for leaks.

e. Refer to the example pages for para. 3-8, Engine and Transmission Oil Cooler Assembly Maintenance, as we review the following points:
1. Modular Text: Both pages of text and illustrations are to be used together. This manual was designed so that the two pages would be visible at once, making part identification and procedure sequence easy to follow.

2. Initial Setup: Outlines task conditions.

3. Illustrations: An exploded diagram of the component shows part locations, attachments, and spatial relationships. Cutaway views (part of the vehicle is "erased") show the location and orientation of screws and attachments.

f. Your manual is easy to use once you understand its design. We hope it will encourage you to use your TM more often as an aid to maintenance support for M998 series vehicles.

## 1-18. Drivetrain Operation

The drivetrain is identical for all models covered in this manual. It converts horsepower into mechanical force to move the vehicle. Major components of the drivetrain are:
ENGINE - The water-cooled 6.2 liter, V-8, Diesel engine provides up to 150 horsepower at 3600 rpm to power the vehicle. The 6.5 liter V-8 engine develops approximately 160 horsepower at 3400 rpm to power the vehicle. The engines are essentially the same on all models except those equipped with deep water fording kit installed, which adds a specially sealed dipstick, dipstick tube, and vented CDR valve.

These differences do not affect engine performance. TRANSMISSION (3L80) - Adapts engine power to meet different driving conditions. The automatic transmission has three forward speeds, a reverse and a neutral. A neutral safety switch prevents the vehicle from being started with the transmission in any selector lever position except neutral. TRANSMISSION (4L80E) - Adapts engine power to meet different driving conditions. The automotic transmission has four forward speeds, a reverse, a neutral and a park. A neutral safety switch prevents the vehicle from being started with the transmission in any selector lever position except park and neutral. TRANSFER CASE - Directs engine-to-transmission power to front and rear differentials simultaneously. This condition means the vehicle is always in four-wheel drive. The transfer case allows for selection of three drive ranges and a neutral position. A complete description of these driving ranges and the recommended driving conditions during which they are used can be found in TM 9-2320-280-10.

PROPELLER SHAFTS - Link transfer case to differentials. Universal joints, located at either end of the front and rear propeller shafts, permit inline driving power between the transfer case and differentials even though they are mounted at different angles.

DIFFERENTIALS - Transmit driving power, via halfshafts and geared hubs, to left and right wheels. The differential ensures power is applied to the wheel having traction, regardless of which wheel is slipping. This feature is called torque biasing. HALFSHAFTS - Transmits power from differentials to geared hubs.

GEARED HUBS - Serve as the front wheel steering spindle and act as the final drive components

## 1-19. Fuel System Operation

The HMMWV diesel fuel system operation is identical for all models covered in this manual. It stores, cleans, and supplies fuel for the engine. Major components of the fuel system are:
FUEL PUMP - Draws fuel from fuel tank through the supply line and pumps it to the fuel filter.

FUEL RETURN LINE - Directs unused fuel from the injection pump back to the fuel tank.

FUEL SUPPLY LINE - Directs fuel from fuel tank to the system.

FUEL TANK - Stores 25 gallons of diesel fuel.

FUEL FILLER CAP - Located at right rear side of vehicle, the cap is removed to permit fuel tank servicing.

FUEL INJECTORS - Receive metered fuel from the injection pump and sprays fuel into the combustion chamber.

FUEL FILTER/WATER SEPARATOR- Filters water and sediment from fuel before fuel enters the injection pump.

INJECTION PUMP - Directs metered and pressurized fuel to the eight injector nozzles. It is

(1) An item is CORRECTLY ASSEMBLED when it is in proper position and all parts are present. (2) When wires, nuts, washers, hoses, or attaching hardware cannot be moved by hand, or wrench, they are SECURE.

(3) An item is WORN if there is too much play between joining parts or when marking data, warning, and caution plates are not readable.

(4) An item is UNSERVICEABLE if it is worn beyond repair and is likely to fail before the next scheduled inspection.

(5) LEAKS. TM 9-2320-280-10 contains definitions of Class I, II, and III leaks and their effect on vehicle operation.

(6) If an item meets the specified lubrication requirements, then it is ADEQUATELY LUBRICATED.

b. Where the instruction "tighten" appears in a procedure, you must tighten with a wrench to the given torque value even when the item appears to be secure.

### .Warning.

Drycleaning solvent is flammable and will not be used near an open flame. A fire extinguisher will be kept nearby when the solvent is used. Use only in well-ventilated places. Failure to do this may result in injury to personnel, and/or damage to equipment.

c. Where the instruction "clean" appears in a procedure, you must use drycleaning solvent (Appendix C,
Item 18) to clean grease or oil from metal parts. After the item is cleaned, rinsed, and dried, apply a light grade of oil to unprotected surfaces to prevent rusting.

d. Clean rubber and plastic materials with soap and water. Refer to TM 9-2320-280-10 for general vehicle cleaning instructions.

## 2-11. Specific Pmcs Procedures

a. The preventive maintenance for which you are responsible is provided in Table 2-1. The checks and services listed are arranged in logical order requiring minimal time and effort on your part.

b. The following columns read across on the PMCS schedule:
(1) Item Number. Provides logical order of PMCS performance and is used as a source number for DA Form 2404, on which your PMCS results will be recorded.

(2) Intervals. Shows the interval next to each item number to indicate when that check is to be performed. The interval will be repeated when consecutive item numbers are to be inspected during the same interval. Interval columns include:
(a) Semiannual (six month) checks; (b) Annual (yearly) checks; and
(c) Biennial (every two years) checks.

(3) Item To Be Inspected. Lists the system, common name, or location of the item to be inspected. (4) Procedures. Provides instructions for servicing, inspection, lubrication, replacement, or adjustment, and in some cases, having item repaired at a higher level.

### Note

Always do your preventive maintenance checks and services in the order prepared. Once it gets to be a habit, you will be able to spot anything wrong in a hurry.

(5) Not Fully Mission Capable. If vehicle meets criteria in this column, vehicle is not mission capable (NMC).

## Section Iv. Electrical/Mechanical Systems Troubleshooting 2-12. General

a. This section provides information to diagnose and correct malfunctions of the electrical/mechanical system.

b. Principles of operation showing system operation can be found in chapter 1. It should be used as a reference when performing electrical/mechanical troubleshooting.

c. Each malfunction symptom given for an individual component or system is followed by step(s) you should take to determine the cause and corrective action you must take to remedy the problem.

d. Before taking any action to correct a possible malfunction, the following rules should be followed:
(1) Question operator to obtain any information that might help you determine the cause of the problem. (2) Never over look the chance that the problem could be of simple origin. The problem could be corrected with minor adjustment. (3) Use all senses to observe and locate troubles. (4) Use test instruments or gauges to help you determine and isolate problem. (5) Always isolate the system where the malfunction occurs and then locate the defective component. (6) Use standard automotive theories and principles when troubleshooting the vehicles covered in this manual.

e. The STE/ICE-R is an integral part of these troubleshooting procedures. It should be used whenever possible, although other options are given, when available. The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) assigned to the M998 series vehicles is 21 (14 is the temporary VIN). On page 2-753, you will find information on STE/ICE-R description and operation. Use this information to become familiar with STE/ICE-R operation and the equipment contained in the test set. On page 2-763 you will find STE/ICE- R setup and internal checks. These must be performed prior to performing tests.

# 2-15. Glossary Of Abbreviations And Commonly Used Terms

PCB - Protective Control Box, located on the firewall above the brake pedal.

STE/ICE-R - Simplified Test Equipment for Internal Combustion Engines - Reprogrammable, a testing system used for performing tests and measurements on the vehicle. In addition to acting as a conventional digital multimeter to measure voltage, current and resistance, it is also capable of measuring pressure, speed, compression unbalance, engine power, and some specialized battery and starter evaluations. It is powered from the vehicle batteries. The complete system includes a vehicle test meter
(VTM), a transducer kit (TK), cables, transit case and technical publications.

DCA - Diagnostic Connector Assembly, an electrical harness on the vehicle which allows the STE/ICE-R
to be powered and to make measurements of key vehicle signals from a single connection. In addition to many basic electrical signals such as starter voltage and current, it includes engine speed and fuel supply pressure. The STE/ICE-R can make TK measurements at the same time that it is connected to the DCA.

VTM - Vehicle Test Meter, a box which performs the measurement and analysis functions of the STE/ICE-R systems.

TK (and TK mode) - Transducer Kit, a collection of transducers, adapters and fittings which permit the STE/ICE-R to be used as a general purpose measurement system for any application. This allows the STE/lCE-R to be used anywhere that you want to measure voltage, current, resistance, pressure, or speed. TK mode of operation is what you are doing when you use this kit (as opposed to DCA mode where you are using the vehicle's built-in sensors to make measurements).

Compression unbalance - A STE/ICE-R test that gives an indication of any engine cylinders that have lower compression then the average. It does this by monitoring the battery voltage during cranking. As each cylinder goes into compression, the extra load on the starter shows up as a drop in voltage. This works well for finding one or more cylinders that have a compression problem, but don't forget that it doesn't give the average compression. If all cylinders are low by the same amount, this test doesn't find it.

Troubleshooting - the process of making measurements and observing the operation of the vehicle to find out if anything is wrong with it and then to locate any problem that exists.

Diagnostics - Troubleshooting by following an exact procedure.

Test Chain - a series of tests to be followed in a particular order or sequence. It is referred to as a "chain" of tests because they are all connected one after another like the links of a chain.

System - a collection of devices which are all related to each other because they depend on each other to do some function or job. For instance, the function of the fuel system is to inject fuel into the cylinders at the correct time in the correct amount and with the correct quality. The collection of devices that are required to do this include the fuel pump, fuel lines, lift pump, fuel filter, injection pump, and injectors.

# 2-15. Glossary Of Abbreviations And Commonly Used Terms (Cont'D)

Functional flow schematic - a diagram which is much like a normal electrical circuit diagram, except that its purpose is to show the flow of information through the system (or the flow of a signal or the flow of some material such as the fuel). This kind of diagram shows how each component or device depends on the others. It is called functional flow because it shows the function (purpose of each component) and how the output of one component "flows" into the next. For troubleshooting, the functional flow schematic is better than the usual circuit diagram because it allows you to quickly see how the system works and what to expect when you make measurements on a system that has faults. You can't expect the output of a device to be good when it has a bad input.

## 2-16. Electric Circuit Description

An electrical circuit is a collection of electrical devices which are connected in a loop from a positive voltage source (the battery positive) to a negative source ( the battery negative). It must be continuous, with no breaks (no opening in the loop) so that electrical current can flow from the positive to the negative. You can think of it like the plumbing in your house. There must be a source of water under pressure or nothing will flow through the pipes. Water pressure is like the positive voltage of the battery. There may be branches (tees) in the pipes going to several different places, but if you don't connect the pipes, you don't get water. The same thing is true with the electrical circuit. If the wires aren't connected, no electricity will flow through them.

In the plumbing of a house, all of the water must go to the drain (you won't permit it to be spilled on the floor). With the vehicle electrical circuit, the drain is the negative terminal of the battery. With the water pipes, the water always flows from high pressure to low pressure (another way of saying that water always flows downhill). The electrical current is the same as the water flow - it always goes from positive to negative voltage. Voltage is to electricity what pressure is to water. Just like the pressure in the water pipe, the greater the voltage, the more electricity will flow through the wires.

Unlike the water pipes that will spill the water if they break, you can't "spill" the electricity. The closest thing to this in an electrical circuit is when two wires touch that aren't supposed to and the current flows to some place that it shouldn't (this is called a "short circuit" or a "short"). Shorts often happen where the wire touches the vehicle body (the body is connected to the negative terminal of the battery). Since the current always flows through the easiest path to negative, it will bypass the rest of the circuit where it was supposed to go, and go through the short directly to the battery. Because this new path to the battery negative is shorter the malfunction is called a "short circuit" or a "short".

If you put a valve in a water pipe, you can control how much water flows by closing the valve. What you are doing is pinching off the pipe with the valve which restricts the flow. If you shut it off completely, you can stop all water from flowing. In the electrical circuit, a resistor acts like a valve. If you make the resistor extremely large, you can stop the current from flowing. The resistance is measured in "ohms".

2-16. ELECTRIC CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION (CONT'D)
When there is no electrical connection, such as when a wire is disconnected, the resistance is infinite (too large to be measured). No current will flow through the wires, because the circuit is no longer continuously connected. This is referred to as an "open circuit" or simply an "open". Remember that an electrical circuit is formed by continuous loops of devices connected together. When you are troubleshooting you are often asked to check for "continuity", which simply means that you need to find out if there is a continuous path from one place in the circuit to another. Since you are trying to see if the path is continuous, you must check wires and switches rather than any special or active devices. You will usually just measure the resistance between two points. If the resistance is zero (or the value of any resistance that is supposed to be there), then there is continuity. In the case of looking for a short, this may mean that you have found the short. If the resistance is off-scale on the meter (infinite resistance) then there is no connection and you have found an open. A continuity test is the same whether you are looking for an open or a short, the only difference being what resistance values you are looking for and where you make the measurements. You are familiar with the typical light switch which allows you to turn a light on and off. A switch of any kind in an electrical circuit is simply a way of opening the loop so that no current will flow through it.

Something to remember while troubleshooting is that everything on the positive side of the switch still has full battery voltage while everything from the switch on through the rest of the circuit is (or should be)
connected to the battery negative terminal and you will measure zero volts. This is easy to remember if you think of the faucet on a sink. If you shut off the faucet, there is no water flowing into the sink, but the water in the pipe is still under pressure.

Sometimes a switch is turned on and off automatically. An example is a "circuit breaker" which is a device that measures how much current is flowing through it. If the current goes too high (possibly damaging equipment or melting the wires) then it opens an internal switch to stop the current flow. A
"relay" is another form of switch that is turned on and off under remote control using a signal in another wire. When a device which requires a very large amount of current (such as the starter motor), must be turned on and off, a "power relay" is used. The idea is to use a small switch to turn on a larger switch.

Thus, you don't have very large wires going all over the vehicle or large switches on the instrument panel.

In the case of the starter's power relay, it is also called a "solenoid". A solenoid is any device that changes the electrical current into a forward and backward motion. It is something like an electrical motor except that instead of continuously going around in the same direction, it goes in or out. For the starter, the solenoid is used to "push" a very large switch into the "on" position.

When testing a circuit, you will need to know how much current is flowing. Current is easilly measured with the STE/lCE-R. A device called a "shunt" is connected to the negative terminal of the battery. A
shunt is a very precise resistor designed so that for every 1000 amps of current that flow through it there is a drop of .1 volts from one side of it to the other (different shunts may have different values). By measuring the voltage across the shunt you know how much current is flowing through the circuit. The shunt is placed on the negative side because it is safer (less chance of accidents which may short out the batteries). Since all of the current eventually goes through the negative battery terminal anyway, the shunt gives the same measurement as if it were connected to the positive terminal. You can think of the shunt as doing the same thing as the water meter in your house. As you turn devices such as lights on or off, you can use the shunt to measure how much current they are using.

# 2-17. Startability Tests

This is a top level test for problems with an engine that doesn't start, or starts but immediately stops, or is very hard to start. If the engine starts but doesn't run well after starting. trv the "STARTABILITY" tests first.

FOR THE ENGINE TO START, ALL OF THE BASIC SYSTEMS SHOWN BELOW
MUST BE WORKING. THESE STARTABILITY TESTS WILL HELP YOU TO
VERIFY THE CONDITION OF EACH OF THESE SYSTEMS.

![131_image_0.png](131_image_0.png)

A functional flow schematic is not applicable to this section.

However, so that you may refer to sections as you need them, a quick index to the systems required for starting is given here.

STARTABILITY
Make sure all of the vehicle's fluids are at the proper level.

You could still have battery or starter problems with a cranking speed over 100 RPM, but that shouldn't stop the engine from starting.

Tests for the battery and starter can be run separately,  if you want to run them.

BURNS. Always use caution when approaching a hot engine.

NOTE
When using the vehicle's temperature gage to determine engine temperature, don't forget to turn the rotary switch to "RUN".  The gages don't work when power is off.

The colder the engine (and air temperature).

the more you need the glowplugs for starting.

There are some times when you don't need to run the glowplugs test.  If the engine is warm and the problem is there on a hot day, then the problem is probably NOT the glowplugs or cold start advance, and these tests may be bypassed. If it's colder than 50°F, run the glowplugs test, because just a few bad glowplugs can make a minor starting problem much worse.

If the vehicle passes the STE/ICE-R compression unbalance test, it may still have a compression problem, but it would mean that every cylinder has low compression. This is possible, but not too likely. If you're confident that everything else is working properly, notify DS maintenance.

### Engine Power Test (Percent) Steace-R Test #13

1. Set TEST SELECT switches to 13.

2. Press and release TEST button.

3.  Wait for prompting message CIP to appear.

4.  When CIP appears on display, press down sharply on engine accelerator and hold it to the floor. When VTM displays OFF,
release accelerator.

5. A number will be displaved after the engine has returned to idle speed. This number is the test result in units of per cent of nominal rated power.

### Engine Power Test (Rpm/Sec) Steace-R Test #12

1. Set TEST SELECT switches to 12.

2. Press and release TEST button.

3.  Wait for prompting message CIP to appear. 4. When CIP appears on display, press down sharply on engine accelerator and hold it to the floor. When VTM displays a number, release accelerator.

5. A number will be displayed after the engine has returned to idle speed. This number is the test result in units of rpm's per second.

It is normal for the engine to emit some black smoke when accelerating after idling for a while.  Under most other conditions, exhaust smoke is usually from one of three sources; BLUE smoke is usually oil.

BLACK smoke is too much fuel or too little air. (Often caused by advanced injection timing).

WHITE smoke is usually water. (Often caused by retarded iniection timing).

If the smoking is continuous or appears under a particular condition, the smoke probably indicates a problem and should be investigated.

If STE/ICE-R is not available, there is no easy way to test compression. In this case, go on to the next step but remember that compression may be a problem.

### Compression Unbalance Steace-R Test 14

1. Run tests 72,73 and 74 to verify that the batteries are ok.

2. THE GLOWPLUG CONTROLLER AND THE
CONTROL VALVE ELECTRICAL
CONNECTOR MUST BE DISCONNECTED
PRIOR TO RUNNING THIS TEST.

3. Disconnect wire 54A at injection pump to prevent starting.

4. Disconnect glowplug controller and control valve electrical connector. (to keep waveform clean).

5. Start Test 14, compression unbalance.

6. Walt for the GO message. Crank the engine.

7. Release the rotary switch when the VTM
displays OFF. A number less than 25%
is passing.

If STE/ICE-R is not available, accelerate under full power to a safe and reasonable speed on a level surface. For STE/ICE-R test \#12, a number higher than 6700 is passing. For test \#13, a number higher than 75 is passing.

This paragraph is a top level test for all of the lubrication systems in the vehicle. Just follow the path, answering the questions. Additional information and notes are given on the facing page when necessary.

The HMMWV includes a venting system that is also checked in this paragraph. The purpose of the vent system is to allow vapor to escape to the atmosphere under normal operation, and to prevent venting during deep water fording operations. If the vents were left open, water would enter the engine and other systems and cause damage. The location of the vent lines is shown below. The location of the other parts in the lubrication system are shown in other lower level paragraph as required.

PROCEDURE FOR CHECKING TRANSMISSION FLUID
1. Start engine.

![154_image_0.png](154_image_0.png) 2. Hold down brake pedal and move transmission shift lever through all ranges including reverse. 3. Engage parking brake and place shift lever in neutral. Check fluid level on dipstick. 4. Proper level is between "FULL" and "ADD" marks on dipstick.

NOTE
CHECK FLUID FOR A BURNT SMELL, GRIT, DISCOLORATION, AIR BUBBLES, OR A MILKY APPEARANCE.

- Burnt smell, discoloration, or grit indicates worn or damaged internal components. Notify DS maintenance.

- Bubbles indicate an overfilled system or air leaks in the system. Drain the fluid and refill to proper level. Refer to (para. 5-2).

- Milky appearance is due to water in the system. Drain the fluid from the entire transmission and transmission cooling system and install a new filter.

 Refer to (para 5-2). 

- Check fill tube for indications of fluid being blown out. If fluid is being blown out, check vent line for obstructions, and refill transmission to proper level. Refer to (para. 5-2). 

- Transmission fluid coming out of dipstick filler tube indicates a restriction in the ventilation system. Check for clogged, melted, or crushed lines and/or fittings between transmission and atmosphere vent on air cleaner canister. Replace where needed. Refer to (para. 5-16).

Among the items are the driveshafts, suspension, differentials, and geared hubs.

## 2-21. Electrical Tests

Most of the electrical circuits in the vehicle are included in one of the major systems covered by this manual. This is a top level paragraph to help you pick the right one. A number of schematics are also included to help you find the problem. If you go through the flowchart and can't solve the problem, use the schematics to find wires which may be causing trouble. The Electrical System consists of the batteries, which produce electrical power by a chemical reaction between the lead plates and the electrolyte solution (a mixture of acid and water).

This power is carried by wires and cables to those parts of the vehicle which require electrical power. The batteries get recharged by the alternator, which generates electrical power by using some of the engine's mechanical power, produced when the engine is running. If you are not too confident about electrical concepts and terminology, you should read Paragraph 2-16, page 2-39. All electrical systems require a connection to ground (called grounding), which is the completion of the circuit to the battery negative. Pages 2-66, 2-67 and 2-68 are diagrams of the grounding. If your vehicle exhibits strange symptoms that seem to defy all efforts to fix them, the vehicle may have a grounding problem. Grounding problems cause strange symptoms usually because more than one circuit is using the same ground, or because a circuit has more than one ground. For example, looking at the body ground diagram, if wire 58D (a ground for the instruments) is disconnected from the left side cylinder head, the instruments may still function due to the separate ground, but they would probably be erratic and inaccurate. Usually the problem will be a loose or corroded connection between the circuit, through body ground to battery negative terminal. Be sure to check continuity to battery negative cable rather than simply to the vehicle body or engine block. After the grounding diagrams are functional flow schematics of the major systems in the

vehicle. The shaded areas are the wires and components of the vehicle master power distribution. These are designed to help you find the system giving you problems.

ELECTRICAL
The lights are the only circuit on the vehicle which should work or be drawing any power when the switch is in the STOP position. Check the instruments, try turning on the heater fan, listen for any relay clicking or other sign (includes engine running) that power is on when It should't be.

It's best if you use the STE/ICE-R in TK mode to verify that there is no current draw from the batteries. You can't use the DCA mode for this because it will measure this current during the calibration part of the test and think that this is just an offset in the sensor.

## 2-22. **Fuel System Tests**

These Fuel System tests can be run any time you think there maybe a problem with the fuel system or if you were sent here from another test.

If you are running this test because the engine runs rough remember that air intake and exhaust as well as internal mechanical problems can also cause this condition. At the bottom of this page is a simplified block diagram which shows how the different fuel system

![181_image_0.png](181_image_0.png)

components relate to each other. Refer to fold-out page FO-1, leave open for reference while you are testing.

This set of tests maybe used when the engine is hard starting, has low power or runs rough. Just follow the path, answering the questions. Additional information and notes are given on the facing page (like this one) when necessary. It is recommended that you refer to your fold-out diagram now because it will help you follow the testing.

doesn't, than ANSWER NO TO THIS
QUESTION.

NOTE: Nothing will come out unless the engine is running or cranking. Close the drain valve and turn the rotary switch to STOP. Check the fuel that came out to be sure that it isn't contaminated with water or dirt.

If the fuel didn't come out in a steady stream or if it is contaminated then ANSWER NO TO THIS QUESTION.

If you have trouble starting the engine you should have entered here byway of the Statability tests. If you didn't begin there, go beck to Page 2-41 and the the Startability top level teat.

At this point you don't care how well it starts or runs but just that it will run. THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS NO if the engine seems to start but stops almost immediately.

Engine temperature may be determined from vehicle temp. gauge (Rotary Switch must be in RUN position) or by touching fortably than it is above 120° F (49° C).

Hard stating can be caused by other things such as fuel in the lines leaking back into the tank while the engine is shut down. This will occur if there is an air leak in the lines.

FUEL SYSTEM
Watch the fuel pump pressure while slowly accelerating the angina from idle to maximum speed. The pressure should always be greater than zero. If pressure, check to be sure it is still above zero even during maximum acceleration (maximum engine power). You can use STE/ICE test 24 with control function 02 (minimum).

NOTE
Rapidly accelerating the engine with the transmission in neutral doesn't work for this engine because the fuel supply can't increase as fast as the engine can accelerate so you won't get good test results.

Proper engine performance is dependent upon the availability of the correct fuel volume to the injection pump.

Pay attention to when the engine runs rough. If it runs rough only while warming up after a cold start it may be a glowplug problem and you should run the Glowplug Circuit tests. Rough running may also be caused by air leaks in the fuel supply lines. Air in the fuel should purge itself while idling. If rough running occurs after a period of high speed or high power running but seems to go away after idling, then look for air leaks in the fuel supply lines and fittings. if rough running occurs while driving but idles ok, check the fuel return check valve for any malfunctions (refer to para. 3-35).

#### Note

Try to adjust the engine idle speed by turning the idle speed screw (refer to para 3-44).

Continue testing if you can adjust the speed properly. If you cannot, notify DS maintenance.

Engine must be at normal operating temperature when making speed checks. Air fitter must be in place and all accessories (lights, heater fan, etc...)
must be turned off.

This engine has a min-max governor which controls engine speed at both idle and full throttle.

![186_image_0.png](186_image_0.png)

FUEL SYSTEM
Governor no-load speed is with the transmission in neutral. Loaded speed is with the transmission in gear and the vehicle moving. It is the maximum rpm's the engine will develop. The engine will surge at governor speed since the governor will try to lower the engine speed and the accelerator is trying to increase it.

A number over 75 is passing for STE/lCE-R
test 13. tf the vehicle seems to be low on power while driving you have to check for other things which could cause this such as the transmission.

To try a road test, accelerate the vehicle from 0 to a safe and reasonable speed on a reasonably level road.

NOTE
If the exhaust is not colorless it must be either white, blue or black. If exhaust color is:
WHITE . . . . . . . . . . Go to G, Page 2-122. Also could be injector timing. Notify DS maintenance. BLUE . . . . . . . . . . . . Blue smoke is a sign of oil entering the combustion chambers. It usually enters pest the piston rings or intake valve stem seals. This is an internal engine problem that can't be handled at this level of maintenance. You may want to run the Engine Running Mechanical tests, Page 2-47, before you notify DS Maintenance.

# Reference Information **Fuel System**

Return lines should be inspected for kinks or crushed lines or anything that might restrict fuel flow. Inspect fuel return check valve for any restrictions. Replace valve (para. 3-35). Replace fuel lines. Refer to (para. 3-25).

If you came here from the Startability Tests, return to STEP 5, Page 2-44. If you haven't run the Startability Tests yet, go to STEP 1, Page 2-42.

During high temperature and humidity, early model vehicles can experience difficulty starting while using JP-8 fuel. High temperatures can cause restrictive clearances in some older fuel injection head and rotor assemblies. The engine must be allowed to cool to allow adequate clearance of the pumping plungers to ensure adequate fuel delivery for starting. If this condition persists, run the startability tests. If vehicle passes all startability tests and troubleshooting procedures and still experiences difficulty in hot starting, identify the fuel injection pump and serial numbers. All fuel injection pumps with P/N DB2831-5209, NSN 2910-01-467-9029 incorporated the improved head and rotor assembly, P/N 31506. If your serial number is less than shown in the Serial Number Break Column of the table below, the manufacturer recommends the fuel injection pump to be replaced, tagged as a "no hot restart" condition, and forward for rebuild. Notify direct support maintenance.

FUEL SYSTEM
The engine temperature must be below 90° F (32°C)
to get voltage here. If the engine is warm, either wait for it to cool, or go to step C3 at the bottom of the pegs and remember that the cold advance maybe the problem if everything else checks out OK.

The Glowplugs or the lntake/Exhaust System may be faulty, so you should test them first.

The cold advance circuit advances the fuel injection pump timing approximately 3 to 5 degrees during cold start up. If engine temperature is less than 90°F (32°C), then Advance circuit operation maybe checked as follows:
1.

2.

3.

4.

Start the engine.

Disconnect wire 569B/569D from the Advance Solenoid. If the circuit is working correctly, then engine RPM should decrease.

Look at the advance mechanism on the right side of the fuel injection pump while you connect and disconnect 569D/
569B with the engine running. The advance mechanism should move about 1/4 inch.

If the advance mechanism is stuck, apply some oil at the points shown and try again.

Remember to reconnect any wires that were disconnected during troubleshooting.

1. Connect RED clip to positive, BLACK clip to negative or ground.

2. Start Test 89, DC volts.

FUEL SYSTEM
If you hear a hissing noise while removing the fuel filter cap then either the vent filter is plugged, the vent line is restricted, or the vent valve is restricted. The vent filter is located behind the coolant surge tank.

Replace vent lines or vent line filter, refer to (para. 3-27.)
Replace vent valve, refer to (para. 3-24.)
Diesel fuel is sensitive to temperature. All diesel fuel has a certain amount of paraffin-like components which have high energy value and help improve fuel economy. When temperatures are less than 20°F (-7°C) these components begin turning into wax flakes that can build upon the fuel tank strainer or in the fuel filter. If wax build-up is found, replace the fuel in the tank with a winter grade of fuel if available. You will have to remove the fuel tank if you need to inspect the tank strainer.

Replace fuel tank, refer to (para. 3-24.)

FUEL SYSTEM
Fuel lines should be inspected for kinks, cracks or anything that would restrict fuel flow or allow air to enter the lines. Be sure to check the lines all the way beck to the tank and remember that there is a strainer inside the tank which can become plugged. You will have to remove the tank if it becomes necessary to check this.

Replace fuel lines, refer to
(para 3-25)
Poor starting and excessive smoke after start up can be the result of a restricted fuel supply. This restriction most likely will be from a plugged fuel filter but can also be caused by a pinched or kinked fuel line.

After the engine warms up, it generally will run satisfactorily. If the restriction gets progressively worse, top speed and performance will be affected also.

#### Fungus

In warm or humid weather, fungi and/or bacteria in the fuel can cause fuel system damage by plugging the fuel lines, filter, or injection nozzles.

For removal, replacement and torques, refer to (para 3-33) or notify DS
maintenance.

Excessive roughness on any of these parts is an indication of wear. The pushrod should slide smoothly in the engine block. If you notice any roughness on the end of the pushrod be sure to check the lobe on the camshaft.

#### Note

If the pump or rod is worn, replace. Refer to (para 3-23). If the lobe on the camshaft is worn, notify DS maintenance.

#### Rerun Test Chain

You may have corrected some problems but there may be others including the fuel pump.

For removal, replacement and torques, refer to (para 3-23).

Be sure to keep the line clear of moving engine parts (fan, pulleys, etc...)
and DO NOT place the line on the exhaust manifold.

Fuel lines should be inspected for kinks, cracks, or anything that would restrict fuel flow or allow air into the lines. Be sure to check the lines all the way back to the tank and remember that there is a strainer inside the tank which can also become plugged. To teat for air leaks in the supply lines, disconnect the return line from the injection pump and connect a line that is long enough to reach the ground.

Place the end of the line into a bucket containing diesel fuel, making sure that the end of the line is below the level of fuel in the bucket. Run the engine and watch for air bubbles in the bucket.

Replace fuel line, refer to (para 3-25).

An important function of all hoses, lines and fittings is to carry fuel without admitting air to the system. When the fuel tank cap is in place and the fuel pump and injection pump are drawing fuel through the lines a low vacuum of 0-1 PSI is created. This occurs because the fuel which the engine uses must be replaced by air. During this vacuum condition, the slightest leak, which may not leak fuel out, could draw air into the system and, depending on the volume of air, cause a wide variety of engine malfunctions.

#### Cold Weather Operation

Diesel fuel is sensitive to temperature. All diesel fuel has a certain amount of wax-like components which have high energy value and help improve fuel economy. When temperatures are less than 20°F (-7°C) these components begin turning into flakes that can build up on the fuel tank strainer or in the fuel filter.

#### Fungus

In warm or humid weather, fungi and/or bacteria can cause fuel system damage by plugging the fuel lines, filter, or injection nozzles.

Old fuel smells like varnish.

Check the accelerator pedal for full movement with no sticking or binding. It you have sticking or binding, lubricate accelerator pedal bushing and bearing with seasonal grade OE oil
(TM 9-2320-280-10). If you do not have full pedal travel then disconnect the accelerator linkage from the fuel injection pump and recheck the travel. It you now have full travel then the problem is in the fuel injection pump and cannot be handled at this level of maintenance. Operation of the injection pump and injectors cannot be verified at this level of maintenance.

Be careful when performing this test. Exhaust gas can be extremely hot end severe bums can result.

Put a piece of paper in the exhaust stream for a few moments with the engine at idle. Then look at the paper to see if there is any condensed fuel on it. Then smell the paper to see if it smells like raw fuel. If it smells like fuel then the engine could be very cold or else it has a DS level fuel system fault or compression fault.

White smoke for a short time after start up, especially on a cold day, is a normal condition. It is caused by incomplete combustion of the fuel because of low cylinder temperature. It should clear up in a few minutes. If not you may have a bed head gasket, cracked block, or a restricted check valve. Check for restricted check valve (para. 3-35).

If the line is clogged, then replace it.  Start the engine and see if it stays running. If it doesn't start or stay running then return to J1 and continue testing. There may be another fuel system fault preventing fuel from reaching this point.

1. Connect RED clip to the indicated test point, BLACK clip to negative or ground.

2. Start Test 89, DC volts.

3. Displayed reading is in volts.

## Battery Voltage Multimeter

1. Set the voltmeter to a DC volts scale of at least 40 volts.

2. Connect the RED lead to positive and the BLACK lead to negative.

3. Be sure to read the correct scale.

If the cold advance solenoid is getting power then the only possibilities that would keep the engine from starting are that fuel is not reaching the cylinders due to a fault in the high pressure side of the fuel system or nearly all the cylinders have very low compression. It is unlikely that all the cylinders would lose compression at the same time, but you may want to run a Compression Unbalance test
(STE/ICE-R Test \#14) to check this.

For repair/replace instructions, refer to (para 4-85).

FUEL SYSTEM

### Note

If you are getting white smoke due to coolant entering the cviinders then you should notice a loss of coolant in the radiator or bubbles in the radiator tank while the engine is running.  You may need to fill the radiator to proper level and recheck a day later to determine if there is a coolant loss.

If you don't detect coolant loss then you may have missed a fuel problem. Rerun the fuel system tests paying attention for a raw exhaust smell.

If you still find nothing you may have a small or inconsistant leak.

Notify DS maintenance.

![215_image_1.png](215_image_1.png)

Keep hands away from engine fan! Moving fan blades can cause serious iniurv. Use extreme caution when engine is running.

If the enaine doesn't shut off with the solenoid disconnected then fuel is still reaching the cylinders- probably because the fuel solenoid is stuck open.  When vou squeeze the return line tight enough to prevent fuel flowing through it, you create a pressure imbalance inside the injection pump that will cause the engine to stall.

# 2-24. Compression/Mechanical Tests

The main intent of this paragraph is to determine if the engine has internal compression or mechanical problems and to fix everything possible without having to notify DS maintenance.

![228_image_0.png](228_image_0.png)

## Reference Information Compression / Mechanical Engine Rpm Steace-R Test 10

1. Start Test 10, Engine RPM.

2. Crank or start the engine. Displayed reading is RPM. Cranking RPM should be approximately 100-200. Idle RPM should be

![229_image_0.png](229_image_0.png)

625 - 675.

A healthy engine should crank at least 100 RPM when it's cold and at least 180-200 RPM
when it's wam.

If the engine doesn't crank at normal speed then it could be due to a Starter or Battery Circuit fault or it may be due to an internal engine problem.

OIL PRESSURE
SENDING UNIT

Oil pressure may go as high as 80 psi if the engine is cold and should be 10 psi minimum at idle speed.  You should check the oil pressure with the STE/ICE-R (test 50) using 1000 psi transducer (blue stripe).  Check pressure at idle and at 2000 RPM.  If pressure is low, check oil level and condition.  Add or change oil as required.

## Oil Pressure Steace-R Test 50

1. Install STE/ICE-R 0 to1000 PSI transducer (blue stripe) in place of oil pressure sending unit.

2. Connect to STE/ICE-R TK connector J2 or J3.

3. CAL with engine off.

4. Start engine.  Run test 50.  With the engine warm, oil pressure should be 10 psi minimum at idle and 40-45 psi at 2000 RPM.  Pressure may go as high as 80 psi when the engine is cold.

![230_image_0.png](230_image_0.png)

COMPRESSION / MECHANICAL

![231_image_0.png](231_image_0.png)

This is not to evaluate driving performance. If the engine or the vehicle makes strange noises or vibrations at idle speed, don't rev the engine. If there is a problem internal to the engine, revving the engine could cause major damage (like a rod coming through the engine block).

### Compression Unbalance Ste/Ice-R Test 14

1. Run tests 72, 73, and 74 to verify that the batteries are ok. 2. Disconnect wire 54A at injection pump to prevent starting.

#### Caution

The glowplug controller and the control valve electrical connector must be disconnected prior to running this test.

3. Disconnect glowplug controller and control valve electrical connector. 4. Start Test 14, Compression Unbalance. 5. Wait for the GO message. Crank the engine. 6. Release the rotary switch when the VTM
 displays OFF. A number less than 25% 
 is passing.

If the vehicle passes the STE/ICE-R Compression

![231_image_1.png](231_image_1.png) Unbalance Test, it may still have a compression problem, but it would mean that every cylinder has low compression. This is possible, but not too likely. If you don't find a problem and suspect compression, notify DS maintenance to measure compression.

If STE/ICE-R is not available, accelerate under full power to a reasonable speed on a flat, level, paved surface. You have to decide from your own experience whether or not the engine is developing full power. A number greater than 75 is passing for test \# 13.

### Power Test (% Power) Ste/Ice-R Test 13

1. Start and idle engine. 2. Run STE/ICE-R test \#10 to set idle and governor speed as necessary. 3. Start STE/ICE-R test \#13. 4. When CIP appears on the display, press down sharply on the accelerator and hold it to the floor until the VTM displays OFF. 5. Displayed value is % POWER.

### Battery Voltage Steace-R Test 67

1. Start Test 67, Battery Voltage.

2. Displayed reading is in volts. Batteries should be 23-25.5 volts. Batteries voltage will drop when glowplugs turn on.

## Compression / Mechanical

### Starter First Peak Current Steace-R Test 72

1. Disconnect wire 54A at injection pump to prevent starting.

2. Disconnect glowplugs controller and fan solenoid.

3. Start Test 72, starter first peak current.

4. Wait for the GO message. Crank the engine.

5. Result is displayed in amps. Starter first peak should be over 400 amps.

### Starter Average Current Steace-R Test 71

1. Start Test 71, Starter Average Current.

2. Displayed reading is in amps. The starter should draw at least 200 amps with a peak of over 400 amps.

The Starter Circuit Tests begin on page 2-261.

Internal engine problems (tight main or rod bearings for example) or drivetrain problems could still cause the engine to crank slowly even if the Starter and Battery Circuits are OK.

## Battery Internal Resistance Steace-R Test 73

1. Disconnect wire 54A at injection pump to prevent starting.

2. Disconnect glowplugs controller and fan solenoid.

3. Start Test 73, Battery Internal Resistance.

4. Wait for the GO message. Crank the engine.

5. Result is displayed in milliohms. Battery resistance should be 25 milliohms max.

![233_image_0.png](233_image_0.png)

Be sure to disconnect fuel solenoid (wire 54A) to prevent accidental starting. Failure to do so may result in injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

A breaker bar and socket placed on the crankshaft pulley can be used to try to turn the crankshaft.  The crankshaft pulley is located directly under the engine cooling fan. It can be reached from under the HMMWV.

If the engine won't turn, remove the glowplugs and try again.  If the engine turns now, try cranking it and look for fuel at the eight glowplug holes. If you see fuel at any of the holes then the engine may have had hydrostatic lock. Crank the engine for about 15 seconds to clear the fuel then re-install the glowplugs and try to start the engine.  If it still won't crank, notify DS maintenance.

## Starter Circuit Resistance Steace-R Test 74

1. Disconnect wire 54A at injection pump to prevent starting.

2. Disconnect glowplugs controller and fan solenoid.

3. Start Test 74, Starter Circuit Resistance.

4. Wait for the GO message. Crank the engine.

5. Result is displayed in milliohms. Starter circuit resistance should be 25 milliohms max.

![234_image_0.png](234_image_0.png)

COMPRESSION / MECHANICAL
Try the following steps:
1. Determine what noises or vibrations are there when the engine is running with the transmission in neutral.

2. Keep the engine running, put the transmission in drive and take note of any changes in the noises or vibrations.

3. If it's safe to drive, drive the vehicle and take note of any changes in the noises or vibrations. Drive vehicle through all gears and ranges within speed rates listed in TM 9-2320-280-10.

## 2-25. Engine Cooling Tests

These Engine Cooling tests may be run any time you think you have an engine cooling problem or if you were sent here by another test chain. Just follow the path, answering the questions. Additional information and notes are given on the facing page when necessary. Please note that this paragraph is NOT for diagnoses of problems with the temperature sending unit or the gauge.

Once you are sure that the cooling system is OK, run the instruments test in Paragraph 2-32 to find out if the gauge is OK.

Fold-out FO-4 contains a functional diagram of the engine cooling system. This page may be left open for reference while testing.

The engine cooling system is a pressure type cooling system with thermostatic control of coolant circulation. The cooling system dissipates heat generated from combustion and maintains the engine operating temperature at its most efficient level. When the engine is cold and the thermostat is closed, coolant is recirculated through the water pump and engine. As the engine coolant reaches 190°F (87.7°C), the thermostat opens allowing coolant to flow through the radiator before returning to the water pump and engine. Any air or vapor in the cooling system will be forced to the surge tank under the liquid level and leave through a vent tube. As the system cools, the extra coolant in the tank will be drawn back to the radiator. Normally a 50-50 mixture of water and ethylene glycol base antifreeze will be used. The fan is activated when coolant temperature reaches 215°F (102°C). A separate oil cooler is mounted in front of the radiator. This cooler is divided into two parts.

The top half is for transmission oil. The bottom half is for engine oil. When the cooling system pressure reaches approximately 15 psi (103 kPa), a valve in the surge tank cap opens and lets excess pressure escape to the atmosphere.

#### Engine Cooling Fan Description Of Operation

An external line from the power steering gear brings hydraulic fluid to the clutch fan solenoid through control valve (normally open) and then to the fan drive, keeping it disengaged. The action of the valve is controlled by the time delay module and the fan temperature switch.

During normal operation, the fan timer switch is closed. This keeps the control valve in the open position and the drive disengaged. As the engine reaches a temperature of 215°F (102°C), the temperature switch opens and the control valve closes. This engages the fan. If the fan is engaged and the accelerator is floored, the transmission kickdown system disengages the fan drive for 20 seconds. The easiest way to determine if the fan is engaged is to stand outside the driver's door and gently work the accelerator. If the fan is engaged, you will feel a breeze from the engine area. If the fan is not engaged, you won't feel the breeze. If the vehicle's serial number is 68555 through 72541 or 100000 through 112867, and you see ADCO stamped on top of the time delay module, replace the module with part NSN 5945-01-193-7175, refer to (para. 4-31).

Look for excessive white exhaust smoke, steam leaks in the engine compartment oil in the coolant.  Other signs include excess condensation in the exhaust system, or white joints in the exhaust system.  You can also feel the coolant hoses to see if they have high pressure caused by leaking combustion gasses. Also, if the glowplugs turn off very quickly after starting the engine, or if the engine overheats, or has excessive coolant consumption, you may have a head gasket problem.

# 2-27. Alternator Tests

These Alternator tests can be run any time you think there may be a problem with the alternator or battery charging or if you were sent here from another system chain. 

These tests are NOT for the batteries. These tests are strictly for the alternator, its operation, and its associated wiring. Tests for the batteries are in Battery Circuit, Paragraph 2-29.

A simplified block diagram for the alternator system is given on page 2-195. A detailed functional flow schematic is provided as foldout FO-6 to help you understand the system as you perform the tests.

### Note

Dual voltage 100, 200, and 400 amp alternators can be installed in a single voltage system. See Table 2-2 for hookup procedures.

After preliminary common tests, the model of alternator must be identified for specific testing to determine if alternator or regulator is defective.

BAD CONNECTIONS ARE THE MOST COMMON PROBLEM !

Sometimes just disconnecting, cleaning, and reconnecting will solve a problem. BE THOROUGH! The time you save may be your own. Refer to the functional flow schematic and check the following; 1. BATTERY - make sure all connections are clean and tight, including the shunt and power stud. 2. STARTER - check the high current (heavy gauge wire 6A) wire at the starter. Don't just check for voltage; a loose connection will have voltage but can't carry much current. 3. PCB/DISTRIBUTION BOX

![279_image_1.png](279_image_1.png)

Disconnect negative battery cable before disconnecting and reconnecting PCB/distribution box harness.

There is battery voltage at the PCB/distribution box at all times. Failure to disconnect battery cable will result in damage to equipment or injury to personnel.

Unscrew BOTH connectors and look for bent or broken pins, pins pushed out of their socket, or dirt and corrosion in the connections.

There is battery voltage at the PCB/distribution box at all times. Failure to disconnect battery cable will result in damage to equipment or injury to personnel.

#### Note

When checking for voltage or continuity in a harness connector (steps A2 and A3), check the wiring at the connector carefully for broken wires. Check to see that the connector pins are not bent, broken, or pushed out of place. Check that the connections are clean and tight. Use the STE/ICE-R in TK mode for this measurement. DO NOT USE THE DCA. Leave the negative battery cable off for the measurement. If there is an open circuit, the STE/ICE-R will measure close to 500 ohms. If you don't have continuity or voltage, and the wires and connections are all ok, then the harness must have a broken wire. In this case you have to replace the wiring harness. Replace harness, notify DS Maintenance. Replace PCB, refer to (para. 4-5). Replace distribution box, refer to (para. 4-5.1).

### Reference Information Protective Control Box/Distribution Box

 NOTE This analyzer requires all glow plugs be serviceable and the batteries fully charged in order to operate properly. Prior to performing diagnostic checks ensure these two items are checked. If either of these two items are found to be faulty, repair/replace prior to beginning checks. Failure to do so will cause the analyzer to give false readings, therefore causing the needless replacement of serviceable components.

Repair lead connectors, refer to
(para. 4-85). 

Repair lead, refer to (para. 4-85).

WARNING

![330_image_0.png](330_image_0.png)

### General Description

The Starter Circuit consists of the batteries, starter solenoid, starter motor, rotary switch, neutral safety switch, protective control box/distribution box, and related electrical wiring. The relationship of these parts is shown in the block diagram above, and a simplified functional flow schematic is provided on the foldout FO-8.

The starter solenoid and starter motor are enclosed in housings to protect them from dirt, icing conditions, and other road hazards.

When the rotary switch is turned to "START," the starter solenoid is energized. The solenoid contacts close, sending battery power to the starter motor. The battery power causes the starter motor pinion gear to engage the engine flywheel ring gear and the engine cranks. When the engine starts, the rotary switch should be released, allowing it to return to the "RUN" position. This deenergizes the starter solenoid which, in turn, disengages the starter motor from the engine.

Solenoid current flows from the rotary switch through the neutral safety switch and protective control box/distribution box to the solenoid.

Disconnect negative battery cable before disconnecting and reconnecting protective control box/distribution box harness.

There is battery voltage at the PCB/distribution box at all times. Failure to disconnect battery cable will result in damage to equipment or injury to personnel.

2 3. PROTECTIVE CONTROL BOX/
DISTRIBUTION BOX - Unscrew BOTH connectors and look for bent or broken pins, pins pushed out of their socket, or dirt and corrosion in the connections. 4. ROTARY SWITCH - Check the wires at the switch. Don't just look. Feel the connections to make sure they're snug. Many problems can be solved by seeing with your fingers, not just your eyes. A cold engine should crank at least 100 RPM. A warm engine should crank at least 180 RPM.

## 2-31. Glowplugs Circuit Tests (Protective Control Box)

These tests of the Glowplugs Circuit can be run anytime you think there may be a problem with the glowplugs, or if you were sent here from another test. 

If you were sent from another test, be sure to mark where you came from so you will be able to return.

If you are running this test because the engine is hard to start when cold, remember that there is also a cold start advance circuit (part of the fuel system) which is not checked here. For any starting problem, we recommend running the "STARTABILITY" test chain just to be sure you don't miss anything. At the bottom of this page is a simplified block diagram which shows how the different parts of the glowplug circuit depend on each other and on other engine circuits. Refer to fold-out page FO-9 and leave it open for reference while preforming these tests. The fold-out diagram is arranged to allow you to follow the diagnostic logic and understand what you are testing, when and why.

![396_image_3.png](396_image_3.png)

## Reference Information **Glowplugs**

If the engine cranks ok (or starts), then the batteries are good enough for testing the glowplugs. If the engine starts, shut it off. You can use STE/lCE Test 10 to measure cranking speed. The engine should crank at least 100 RPM in cold weather and at least 180 RPM in warm weather.

![397_image_1.png](397_image_1.png)

Disconnect negative battery cable before disconnecting and reconnecting protective control box harness.

There is battery voltage at the PCS at all times. Failure to disconnect battery cable will result in damage to equipment or injury to personnel.

#### Bad Connections Are The Most Common

Sometimes, just disconnecting, cleaning and reconnecting will solve a problem. BE THOROUGH ! The time you save may be your own. Refer to the functional flow schematic and check the following 1. BATTERY - make sure all connections are dean and tight, including the shunt and power stud. 2. PROTECTIVE CONTROL BOX - unscrew BOTH
connectors and look for bent or broken pins, pins pushed out of their socket, or dirt and corrosion in the connections. 3. GLOWPLUG CONTROLLER - pop the controller connector off (squeeze the sides) and check the pins in both the controller and the connector. Look for bent, broken or pushed out pins, dirt or corrosion. Check for broken wires at the connector. Take note that pin 2 of the glowplugs controller connector has no pin in it. 4. GLOWPLUGS - Check that all the glowplug wires are snug. Don't just look with your eyes. Many problems are solved by Iooking with your fingers to be sure a connection is snug.

The glowplugs first come ON when the engine temperature is below 120 °F (49°C) and the rotary switch is turned to
"RUN". They stay ON for up to 9 seconds and then go OFF.

They will stay OFF for about 7-15 seconds then come ON
again for about 1 second.

#### Note Note

The WAIT-TO-START lamp is NOT diagnosed in this section. If the lamp does not work property, the glowplug circuit may be affecting its operation.

Run these tests to check out the glowplug circuit. If the lamp still does not work properly, go to the INSTRUMENTS section for a full diagnosis of the

#### Battery Current Multimeter

1. Set the voltmeter to a DC volts scale of about 1 volt.

2. Connect the BLACK lead to the battery side of the current shunt and the RED lead to the other end of the current shunt. 3. Currant shunt voltage is proportional to battery current, 100 millivolts = 1000 amps. To get current, multiply millivolts x 10.

#### Battery Current Ste/Ice-R Test 80

1. Start Test 80, battery currant. 2. Displayed reading is in amps. The reading will be greater then 30 amps, depending on how many accessories you have on.

To check for glowplug current draw, start STE/lCE-R Test 80, battery current. Turn off all accessories (lights, heater, wipers etc). STE/lCE-R should immediately measure at least 74 amps. Take note, however, that if all your glowplugs are working, the current draw should be close to or more than 100 amps, especially if it's cold. If it's near freezing and the glowplugs only draw 75-80 amps, you probably have a few bad glowplugs.

GLOWPLUGS
The glowplugs first come ON when the engine temperature is below 120 °F (49 °C) and the rotary switch is turned to RUN. They stay ON for up to 9 seconds and then go OFF. They will stay OFF for about 7-15 seconds then come ON again for about 1 second, than go OFF again. If you don't start the engine, the glowplugs should keep cycling like this, due to the glowplug cycle timer in the glowplugs controller. It you start the engine, they will cycle until the engine is warm, due to the afterglow cycle timer in the glowplug controller. When the engine gets up to 120 °F (49 °C), the glowplugs should stop cycling completely.

#### Engine Not Running

If the glowplugs are cycling property, you should hear a click from the protective control box (PCB) when the glowplugs turn on and when they turn off. This is the glowplug cycle timer, a thermal circuit breaker. A good way to check for cycling is STE/lCE-R test 80, battery current. When the glowplugs turn on, STE/lCE-R will measure 74-125 amps.

When the glowplugs turn off, the STE/lCE-R will measure 3-8 amps.

#### Engine Running. Rotary Switch In Run

If the glowplugs are cycling properly, you can hear a click from the protective control box (PCB) when the glowplugs turn on and when they turn off (you may have to duck your head under the dash). This is the afterglow cycle timer, a thermal circuit breaker. A good way to check for cycling is STE/ICE-R test 80, battery current. When the glowplugs turn on, STE/lCE-R will measure 74-125 amps. When the glowplugs turn off, STE/lCE-R will measure 3-8 amps. As the engine gets warmer, the glowplugs turn on leas frequently and for baa time.

#### Note

If you don't have a STE/lCE-R or a multimeter for measuring current, you can watch the vehicle volts gauge for indication of glowplug operation. The glowplugs drew so much current that the volts gage should jump about half-an-inch to the left when the glowplugs come on. Before starting the engine, you should hear the glowplug power relay click open and closed as the glowplugs cycle. (You can hear the relay after the engine has started by leaning your head under the dash near the protective control box.) This method won't tell you if all the glowplugs are working property, but it at least shows that the glowplugs are trying to work and that the glowplug power relay is working.

only reason they wouldn't draw
enough current is that the glowplugs themselves are bad or the wires are no good.

Dead glowplugs draw virtually no current, but other parts of the vehicle are drawing some current, up to 8 amps. If any glowplugs are drawing any current, then the protective control box is probably OK.

Disconnect ALL the glowplugs.

![401_image_1.png](401_image_1.png)

1.

2.

Disconnect the negative battery cable. Disconnect the PCB connector harness from the PCB. Reconnect the negative battery cable. Measure the resistance between pin Din the engine connector harness of the protective control box and ground. There should NOT be continuity (resistance reading off-the-scale). If there is continuity, repair or replace the harness.

Repeat the following for each glowplug a.

3.

Reconnect the wiring harness to the glowplug while you repeat the resistance measurement described in step 2. When you reconnect the wire to the glowplug, the resistance should drop to between 1 and 2 ohms (glowplugs are typically 1.6 ohms).

b.

If step a passed; disconnect the glowplug again, making sure the resistance goes off-scale again. Repeat step a for the next glowplug.

If step a failed; then either the glowplug or its wire is no good. Take the wire off the glowplug again and measure the resistance from the glowplug to the engine block. If the resistance is 1-2 ohms, then the cable is no good, otherwise replace the glowplug and check the cable for continuity, just to be sure.

c.

For a good description of how glowplugs cycle and how to check for proper cycling, refer to page 2-307.

Disconnect negative battery cable before disconnecting and reconnecting protective control box harness.

There is battery voltage at the PCB at all times.

Failure to disconnect battery cable will result in damage to equipment or injury to personnel.

If most or all of the glowplugs are bad, you may also have a problem with the protective control box or the glowplug controller which caused them to go bed (usually they burn out from being on too long or not turning off at all). After replacing the bad glowplugs, rerun the glowplugs test chain paying special attention to the glowplugs cycling, especially that they turn OFF when they should.

Replace glowplugs, wires, or harness, refer to (para 3-38).

4.Reconnect the PCB and all wires.

### Note

![403_Image_0.Png](403_Image_0.Png)

Ensure that alternator "AC" tap is functioning correctly by measuring DC volts at wire 2A. Reading should be between 9-16 Vdc. If this votage is not present, glowplug system will never stop cycling. Refer to the functional flow schematic. If the glowplug controller is shorted (continuity from pin 6 to pin 3), the glowplug power relay will always be energized and the glowplugs will always be drawing current.

#### Battery Current Ste/Ice-R Test 80

1. Start Test 80, battery current. 2. Displayed reading is in amps. The reading will be greater than 30 amps, depending on how many accessories you have on.

Since the glowplugs draw current without the glowplug controller connected, there must be a short in the harness or a stuck relay in the protective control box (PCB). If there were a short in the harness directly to the glowplugs, the glowplugs would have burned out long ago and you wouldn't be here. The only other short in the harness that would make the glowplugs turn on without the glowplug controller installed would show up as battery voltage at pin 6 of the controller's connector.

Replace PCB, refer to (para. 4-5).

Check the end of the harness at the protective control box, glowplugs, etc. for shorts. Repair whatever you can. If you don't see anything wrong, the short must be in the main body of the harness, which means that you have to replace the harness.

## 2-31.1. Glowplugs Circuit Tests (Distribution Box)

These tests of the Glowplugs Circuit can be run anytime you think there may be a problem with the glowplugs, or if you were sent here from another test.

If you were sent from another test, be sure to mark where you came from so you will be able to return.

If you are running this test because the engine is hard to start when cold, remember that there is also a cold start advance circuit (part of the fuel system) which is not checked here. For any starting problem, we recommend running the "STARTABILITY" test chain just to be sure you don't miss anything. At the bottom of this page is a simplified block diagram which shows how the different parts of the glowplug circuit depend on each other and on other engine circuits.

#### Bad Connections Are The Most Common

PROBLEM !

Sometimes, just disconnecting, cleaning and reconnecting will solve a problem. BE THOROUGH ! The time you save may be your own. Refer to the functional flow schematic and check the following; 1. BATTERY - make sure all connections are clean and tight, including the shunt and power stud. 2. DISTRIBUTION BOX - unscrew the three connectors and look for bent or broken pins, pins pushed out of their socket, or dirt and corrosion in the connections. 3. GLOWPLUGS - Check that all the glowplug wires are snug. Don't just look with your eyes. Many problems are solved by looking with your fingers to be sure a connection is snug.

#### Normal Glowplug Operation

The glowplugs are heated quickly for 5 to 20 seconds. This cycle is active while the "Wait-to-Start" light is on. The length of "on" time is dependent on battery voltage, the weaker the batteries the longer the "on" time. This cycle will only repeat if the run start switch has been off for more than 2 1/2 minutes. After the initial 5 to 20 seconds preglow, the system goes to afterglow. Afterglow provides lower voltage to the glowplugs to keep them at operating temperature for approximately 60 seconds. 

#### Note

To check for glowplug current draw, start STE/ICE-R Test 80, battery current. Turn off all accessories (lights, heater, wipers etc). STE/ICE-R should immediately measure at least 74 amps. Take note, however, that if all your glowplugs are working, the current draw should be close to or more than 100 amps, especially if it's cold. If it's near freezing and the glowplugs only draw 75-80 amps, you probably have a few bad glowplugs.

REFERENCE INFORMATION
GLOWPLUGS

#### Normal Glowplug Operation

The glowplugs first come ON when the engine temperature is below 120 °F (49 °C) and the rotary switch is turned to RUN. They stay ON for up to 9 seconds and then go OFF. They will stay OFF for about 7-15 seconds then come ON again for about 1 second, then go OFF
again. If you don't start the engine, the glowplugs should keep cycling like this, due to the glowplug cycle timer in the glowplugs controller. If you start the engine, they will cycle until the engine is warm, due to the afterglow cycle timer in the glowplug controller. When the engine gets up to 120 °F (49 °C), the glowplugs should stop cycling completely.

#### Engine Not Running, Rotary Switch In Run.

If the glowplugs are cycling properly, you should hear a click from the distribution box when the glowplugs turn on and when they turn off. This is the glowplug cycle timer, a thermal circuit breaker. A good way to check for cycling is STE/ICE-R test 80, battery current. When the glowplugs turn on, STE/ICE-R will measure 74-125 amps. When the glowplugs turn off, the STE/ICE-R will measure 3-8 amps.

#### Engine Running, Rotary Switch In Run

If the glowplugs are cycling properly, you can hear a click from the distribution box when the glowplugs turn on and when they turn off (you may have to duck your head under the dash). This is the afterglow cycle timer, a thermal circuit breaker. A good way to check for cycling is STE/ICE-R test 80, battery current. When the glowplugs turn on, STE/ICE-R will measure 74-125 amps. When the glowplugs turn off, STE/ICE-R will measure 3-8 amps. As the engine gets warmer, the glowplugs turn on less frequently and for less time.

#### Note

If you don't have a STE/ICE-R or a multimeter for measuring current, you can watch the vehicle volts gauge for indication of glowplug operation. The glowplugs draw so much current that the volts gage should jump about half-an-inch to the left when the glowplugs come on. Before starting the engine, you should hear the glowplug power relay click open and closed as the glowplugs cycle. (You can hear the relay after the engine has started by leaning your head under the dash near the distribution box.) This method won't tell you if all the glowplugs are working properly, but it at least shows that the glowplugs are trying to work and that the glowplug power relay is working.

#### Expected Glowplug Current

ROTARY SWITCH IN RUN POSITION; GLOWPLUGS ON : 74 - 125 AMPS 74 is only for weak batteries. You should get at least 100 amps when glowplugs are working properly.

GLOWPLUGS OFF : AT or NEAR ZERO With the rotary switch in the RUN position, other parts of the vehicle are drawing current. You might measure up to 8 amps.

#### Checking Glowplugs & Their Wires

1.

Disconnect ALL the glowplugs.

![416_image_0.png](416_image_0.png)

2.

Disconnect the negative battery cable. Disconnect the distribution box connector harness from the distribution box. Reconnect the negative battery cable. Measure the resistance between pin D in the engine connector harness of the distribution box and ground. There should NOT be continuity (resistance reading off-the-scale). If there is continuity, repair or replace the harness.

3.

Repeat the following for each glowplug: a.

Reconnect the wiring harness to the glowplug while you repeat the resistance measurement described in step 2. When you reconnect the wire to the glowplug, the resistance should drop to between 1 and 2 ohms (glowplugs are typically 1.6 ohms).

b.

If step a passed; disconnect the glowplug again, making sure the resistance goes off-scale again. Repeat step a for the next glowplug.

c.

If step a failed; then either the glowplug or its wire is no good. Take the wire off the glowplug again and measure the resistance from the glowplug to the engine block. If the resistance is 1 - 2 ohms, then the cable is no good, otherwise replace the glowplug and check the cable for continuity, just to be sure.

4.

Reconnect the distribution box and all wires.

Dead glowplugs draw virtually no current, but other parts of the vehicle are drawing some current, up to 8 amps. If any glowplugs are drawing any current, then the distribution box and glowplug circuit is probably OK.

For a good description of how glowplugs cycle and how to check for proper cycling, refer to page 2-307.

Disconnect negative battery cable before disconnecting and reconnecting distribution box harness.

There is battery voltage at the distribution box at all times. Failure to disconnect battery cable will result in damage to equipment or injury to personnel.

If most or all of the glowplugs are bad, you may also have a problem with the distribution box or the glowplug controller which caused them to go bad (usually they burn out from being on too long or not turning off at all). After replacing the bad glowplugs, rerun the glowplugs test chain paying special attention to the glowplugs cycling, especially that they turn OFF when they should.

Replace glowplugs, wires, or harness, refer to (para. 3-38).

# 2-32. Instrument Tests

These Instrument Tests can be run any time you think there is a problem with the instruments or if you were sent here from another test.

If you get an unusual gauge reading it is a good idea to check out the system that the gauge monitors to be sure that it is a gauge problem and not a real problem in the engine or electrical system.

Refer to fold-out page FO-10 and leave fold-out open for reference during testing. Diagrams of the individual gauge circuits will be found on the page that deals with that circuit.

The volt gauge may be checked by running STE/ICE-R Test 67 with the engine running.

The position in the center of the green area of the volt gauge marked GEN is approximately 26 volts.

The volt gauge is a gatvanometer type gauge. It is conceivable that the coil in the gauge may have a broken wire that only opens when the gauge is heated up. If you are having an intermittent gauge problem, leave the vehicle running for awhile and watch the gauge.

If the charging system is ok, but the gauge is reading full scale one way or the other, then you may have this type of problem.

## 2-33. Light Tests

The Lights paragraph has almost no flow chart to guide you through a problem. This is because there aren't very many problems that can occur. The most common problems are burned-out bulbs and loose or corroded connections. Aside from bulbs and wiring, the only components are the PCB and the lights switch. If either of these is found to be faulty, you just replace the bad unit. On the following pages you will find diagrams of the major portions of the Lights Circuit. These are designed to help you isolate a problem without wasting too much time.

#### Road Test Procedure

1.Position transmission shift lever in "D" (drive) and accelerate vehicle from 0 mph. A 1-2 and 2-3 shift should occur at all throttle openings. Allow vehicle to coast down to about 0 mph and 3-2 and 2-1 shifts should occur. 2.Position transmission shift lever in "2" (low two) and accelerate vehicle from 0 mph. A 1-2 shift should occur at all throttle openings. No 2-3 shift can be obtained in this range. A 1-2 shift in 2 is somewhat firmer than in "D". This is normal. 3.Position shift lever in "1" and accelerate the vehicle from 0 mph. No upshifts should occur in this range. 4.Position shift lever in "D" and with the vehicle speed at approximately 35 mph, close throttle and move lever to "2". Transmission should downshift to 2nd gear. An increase in engine rpm and engine braking effect should be noticed. 5.Position shift lever "2" and with the vehicle speed at approximately 25 mph, close thethrottle and move lever to "1". Transmission should downshift to 1st gear. An increase in engine RPM and engine braking effect should be noticed. 6. Position shift lever in "R" and check for reverse operation. 7. Hard shifting may be indicative of an underfilled or clogged system. The kickdown system is used to shift the transmission to a lower gear under heavy acceleration. The system also disengages the engine cooling fan so as to allow maximum engine power to be used for moving the vehicle.

# 2-35. Transmission System Tests (4L80-E)

The 4L80-E Transmission system is equipped with a computer called the Transmission Control Module (TCM) (located left rear seat compartment; for M996A2 and M997A2 vehicles, located in the left exterior stowage compartment) which interprets, analyzes and records electronic signals form sensors and switches located on the engine, brake pedal, and transmission. The recorded codes stored in the TCM are known as TROUBLE CODES which are retrieved using the Diagnostic Switch Cable on the J2 connector of the TCM. The TCM
can protect the transmission from damage by locking it in Second Gear, with maximum fluid pressure, until the problem has been corrected. The following procedures will detail diagnostic testing, troubleshooting and corrective action for any existing faults. These Transmission System tests may be run any time you think there is a transmission problem or if you were sent here by another test chain. This paragraph has a different kind of flow chart to guide you through testing because of the may problems that can occur. The most common problems are loose or corroded wiring connections. To troubleshoot the transmission, you will need a diagnostic switch cable, digital multimeter and a throttle position (TP) sensor test cable.

### Caution

Do not disconnect battery without recording Trouble Codes. Failure to do so will result in loss of diagnostic test codes.

The diagnostic test codes (DTC) are transmitted from the TCM to transmission lamp located next to the shift lever. When Diagnostic Switch Cable is connected to the J2 connector, the system is placed in the diagnostic mode, which causes the transmission lamp to flash. The transmission lamp will flash once, pause, flash twice (meaning code 12) pause, flash once, pause, flash twice (code 12 again), and do this one more time for a total of three times, which means the system is operational.

### Note

Diagnostic test code 63 will be set at all times.

For example if the TCM is sending the trouble code 74, the lamp will flash 12 three times, flash 63 three times, which is set all the time and is to be disregarded, flash code 7 and 4,7 and 4, 7 and 4 for code 74, and then 12, 12, 12, which ends the diagnostic check. These codes will repeat again, if not taken out of diagnostic mode.

The TCM J1 connector will be used to diagnose and troubleshoot wiring, sensor connectors, pins, solenoids, and brake switch, to insure all external problems are checked and corrected prior to TCM and transmission faults. On the following pages you will find diagrams and charts of the major portions of the transmission circuits. These are designed to help you isolate a problem and correct it.

The camshaft position sensor (CPS) detects the rotational speed of the camshaft. As the camshaft rotates, an AC signal is generated in the circuit.

This signal provides the input to determine engine speed for use in various calculations including TCC
slip speed and overdrive ratio.

### Dtc 71 Will Set When:

- Engine speed less than 50 rpm

- Transmission range indicates, R, D4, D3, or D1. - Conditions are met for 2 seconds.

### Dtc 73 Pressure Control Solenoid (Pcs) Circuit Current Error (Force Motor Circuit) Circuit Description:

The pressure control solenoid is a TCM-controlled device used to regulate transmission line pressure. The TCM compares TP voltage, engine rpm and other inputs to determine the appropriate line pressure of a given load. The TCM will regulate the pressure by applying a varying amperage to the pressure control solenoid. The applied amperage can vary from 0.1 to 1.1 amp. The TCM then monitors the amperage at the return line.

### Dtc 73 Will Set When:

. The return amperage varies greater than 0.16 amps from the commanded amperage.

. All conditions are met for 1 second.

### Dtc 74 Transmission Input Speed Sensor (Tiss) Circuit Circuit Description:

The TISS sensor consists of a permanent magnet surrounded by a coil of wire. As the forward clutch housing rotates, an AC voltage is induced in the circuit. The signal voltage and frequency vary directly with the forward clutch rotational speed.

### Dtc 74 Will Set When"

s Trans range not in park or neutral.

. Engine speed greater than 300 rpm.

- Trans output speed greater than 200 rpm.

- Trans input speed less than 50 rpm.

. All conditions are met for 2 seconds.

DTC 75 System Voltage Low

### Circuit Description:

Ignition voltage is supplied to the control module to indicate the status of the ignition switch. Battery voltage is supplied to the control module to, in part, maintain memory of learned functions and parameters.

### Dtc 75 Will Set When:

- The ignition is "ON." - Ignition feed voltage to the control module is less than the graduated scale of:
. -40°F (-40°C) = 7.3 volts.

- 194°F (-90°C) = 10.3 volts.

- 302°F (-150°C) = 11.7 volts.

- Engine speed greater than 1000 rpm.

- All conditions are met for 4 seconds.

### Dtc 79 Transmission Fluid Overtemp Circuit Description:

The Transmission Fluid Temperature (TFT) sensor is a thermistor that controls the signal voltage to the TCM. The TCM supplies a 5-volt reference signal to the sensor on CKT 923A. When the transmission fluid is cold, the sensor resistance is high and the TCM will sense high signal voltage. As the transmission fluid temperature warms to normal transmission operating temperature 212°F
(100°C), the sensor resistance becomes less and the voltage decreases to approximately 1.5 to 2.0 volts.

### Dtc 79 Will Set When:

- Trans fluid temp greater than 295°F (146°C). - All conditions are met for 30 minutes.

### Transmission System

(4L80-E)

### Dtc 81 2-3 Shift Solenoid Circuit Fault Circuit Description:

Ignition voltage is supplied directly to the 2-3 shift solenoid. The TCM controls the solenoid by providing the ground path through CKT 315A to TCM.

### Dtc 81 Will Set When:

- The TCM commands the solenoid "ON" and voltage remains high.

c The TCM commands the solenoid "OFF" and voltage remains low.

. All conditions are met for 2 seconds.

### Dtc 82 1-2 Shift Solenoid Fault Circuit Description:

Ignition voltage is supplied directly to the 1-2 shift solenoid. The TCM controls the solenoid by providing the ground path through CKT 237A to TCM.

### Dtc 82 Will Set When:

- The TCM commands the solenoid "ON" and voltage remains high.

- The TCM commands the solenoid "OFF" and voltage remains low.

- All conditions are met for 2 seconds.

### Dtc 83 Tcc Solenoid (Pwm) Circuit Fault Circuit Description:

The control module supplies a ground through an internal Quad-Driver Module (QDM) allowing current to flow through the solenoid coil according to the duty cycle (percentage of "ON" and "OFF"
time). This current flow through the solenoid coil creates a magnetic field that magnetizes the solenoid core. The magnetized core attracts the check-ball to seat against spring pressure. This blocks the exhaust for the TCC signal fluid and allows 2-3 drive fluid to feed the TCC signal circuit. The TCC signal fluid pressure acts on the TCC regulator valve to regulate line pressure and to apply fluid pressure to the TCC shift valve. When the TCC shift valve is in the "apply" position, regulated apply fluid pressure is directed through the TCC valve to apply the torque converter clutch.

### Dtc 83 Will Set When:

●
The TCM commands the solenoid "ON" and voltage remains high. The TCM commands the solenoid "OFF" and voltage remains low.

●

●
AU conditions are met for 2 seconds.

## 2-37. Steering System Tests

These Steering System tests may be run any time you have a steering problem or if you were sent here by another test chain. Just follow the path, answering the questions. Additional information and notes are given on the facing page when necessary.

The fold-out page shows the location of the major components of the steering in case you are not familiar with them. These parts are shown in a schematic manner. Illustrations of the actual components are given wherever applicable on the reference pages of the diagnostics.

Fold-out page FO-14 may be left open for reference while testing. The functional flow diagram shows the mechanical and hydraulic parts of the system and how they interact. Even if the hydraulic system fails, you will still be able to steer the vehicle, although it will require more effort.

and man-made obstructions. Failure to do so may result in serious injury.

Visualty inspect steering components:
1. Check all four tires and rims for wear, inflation, damage, or warping.

a. Adjust tire pressure (TM 9-2320-280-10). b. Replace my unserviceable rims (para 8-4).

2. check steering linkage for damage.

a. Replace any damaged steering Iinkage components (para 3-12).

b. Lubricate steering linkage (TM 9-2320-280-10).

3. Check power steeing fluid for contamination and level
(TM 9-2320-280-10).

a. Drain and replace any fluid that appears black and smells burned.

b. Bleed air from system where fluid appears milky white (para 8-29).

4. Check pump drivebelts for fraying, cracks, damage, or misadjustrnent.

a. Replace unserviceable power steering drivebelts (para 3-80).

b. Adjust loose power steering drivebelts (para 3-82).

While travelling at a moderate speed (20mph) (32 kmph), apply the brakes while applying minimal pressure to the steering wheel. If pull to one side or the other occurs, make a note of the speed at which it occurs and on what side of the vehicle it occurs. Repeat this procedure for different speeds and braking forces. If the vehicle seems to steer straight while braking, then there probably isn't a problem with the brakes (at least not one that affects the steering). If the braking action feels strange in anyway, then the brake diagnostics should be run to assure vehicle safety. TM test will usually reveal problems with frozen brake calipers.

If the wheels are out of alignment or if the tires are worn unevenly, vehicle may wander.

Symptoms of bad steering characteristics include hard steering, excesssive play in steering, a momentary increase in steering effort when turning wheel quickly, end jerking of the steering wheel when turning.

See TM 9-2320-280-10 for fluid replacement procedure. For bleeding procedure, refer to (para 8-29). Low fluid level could indicate a problem elsewhere in the system, either leaking hydraulic Iines or a leaking or demaged power steering pump. lf adding fluid seems to cure the problem, you should probably run the reat of the tests to make sure there aren't any other problem.

A Ioose pump, pulley, or bracket could cause excess noise, slipping belts, or other malfunctions. For appropriate repair or replacement procedures, refer to
(para 8-24).

Check hydraulic hoses, power steering pump, power steering cooler, hydraulic control valve, hydro-boost unit, steering gear, fan shroud, and fan clutch. See hose replacement procedures (refer to para 8-25). Check power steering cooler for bent fins or any other airflow restrictions. Straighten fins or replace power steering cooler (para. 8-28) if damaged beyond repair.

1. With engine off, disconnect pressure hose from hydro-boost and connect tube and quickdisconnect to hydro-boost.

### Note

Have drainage container ready to catch fluid.

2. Connect adapter and quick-disconnect to pressure hose.

3. Connect hose from valve on power steering analyzer to tube and quick-disconnect on hydro-boost.

4. Connect hose from gauge side of power steering analyzer to adapter and quickdisconnect on pressure hose.

5. Loosen hose clamp and remove cooler hose from return tube on steering gearbox.

6. Plug hose with plug or bolt (3/8 in. or 10 mm dia.) and secure with hose clamp. 

7. Connect bypass hose to tube on steering gearbox and secure with hose clamp.

19. Ensure analyzer valve is in full open position and engine is at proper idle speed.

20. Initial pressure should be 150-250 psi and a flow of 2.50-3.50 gpm. If these specifications aren't present, check installation of analyzer and check power steering system (Refer to TM 9-2320-280-10).

21. With power steering system working properly, partially close analyzer valve until pressure reaches 700 psi. If flow rate varies more than 1 gpm from the initial reading, replace power steering pump (para. 8-24). 

CAUTION
Do not leave analyzer valve fully closed for more than 5 seconds. Severe damage may occur to power steering pump.

22. With engine at idle, close and open analyzer valve three times, recording pressure each time. All readings should be 1300 psi or higher, if pressure is lower, replace power steering pump (para. 8-24).

23. With analyzer valve in the open position, increase engine rpm to 1500 and record fluid flow. If fluid flow varies more than 1 gpm from initial reading, replace power steering pump (para. 8-24).

24. With engine at idle, turn steering wheel all the way left, hold in place for 5 seconds, then repeat process with steering wheel all the way right and record flow rates. If flow rate does not drop to 1 gpm or less, replace steering gearbox (para. 8-21).

25. With engine at idle, turn wheels slightly left and right and release quickly. If pressure does not increase and snap back within 2 seconds, check steering shaft and column for binding and repeat step 15. If pressure still does not increase and snap back, replace steering gearbox (para. 8-21).

26. With engine at idle, push brake pedal down and hold. Record pressure. If pressure varies more than 50 psi from step 22, replace hydro-boost (para. 7-14).

27. With engine at idle, push brake pedal down and release quickly. If pressure does not increase and snap back within 2 seconds, replace hydro-boost (para. 7-14). 

28. Shut off engine. Remove power steering analyzer and restore power steering system to original configuration. 29. Bleed power steering system (para. 8-29).

NOTE
You must be certain that the engine cooling system is working ok, or this test won't tell you anything. If the engine is cold, and everything is working ok, the fan should be disengaged. You can tell by gently revving the engine in neutral with the hood open. If the fan is engaged you will feel a breeze outside the driver's door. If it's disengaged, you won't feel it. If you aren't sure if it's working ok, run the tests in Paragraph 2-25.

# 2-42. Dca Troubleshooting

These DCA tests can be run anytime you think there is a problem with the vehicle's DCA or its on board transducers. Do not use this paragraph to test the STE/lCE-R and its cables and transducers. Refer to TM 9-4910-571-12&P to test the STE/ICE-R. This paragraph will also supply instructions on how to use the STE/lCE-R in the TK mode to substitute for tests run through the DCA.

The HMMWV is equipped with three transducers - the pulse tachometer, the fuel pressure transducer, and the current shunt. A power test (12, 13) or RPM test (10) uses the pulse tachometer. The fuel pressure test (24) uses the pressure transducer. All of the starting circuit tests and battery tests done through the DCA use the shunt. Check to see that the wires are connected to the transducer for the test you're trying to run. There is a four wire connector for the fuel pressure transducer, a two wire connector for the pulse tachometer, and there are four wires connected to the shunt in addition to the battery cables.

The fold-out page FO-16 gives a cross reference between DCA tests and TK tests. Use this cross reference to find out how to substitute TK tests for DCA tests if you have a bad DCA. The Location of Parts page has a schematic of the HMMWV DCA.

### 2-723

![821_image_0.png](821_image_0.png)

DCA TROUBLESHOOTING
NOTE
The diagnostics in this chapter assume you have already run a test through the DCA. If you haven't run a test and are here to test the entire DCA,  run tests 10 (RPM), 24
(Fuel Pressure) and 80 (BatteryCurrent)  Make note of the results for later. If you want to test the entire DCA hamess, answer YES

![822_image_0.png](822_image_0.png)

here and then return and answer NO when you've finished the test chain. Answer NO here to test the shunt.

Answer NO here to test the pulse tachometer.

Repair wiring or replace transducer, refer to (para 4-26).

![823_image_0.png](823_image_0.png)

DCA TROUBLESHOOTING
The fuel pressure should always be greater than 3 psi. If you get about the same pressure with the 2 transducers, then you have a fuel system problem. Remove fuel pressure transducer, refer to (para 4-26). Make sure the STE/ICE-R is powered by a W5 cable.

## Steace-R Test 49 0 To 25 Psig Pressure

1. CONNECT RED TRANSDUCER TO FUEL
FILTER.

2. CONNECT TRANSDUCER TO A W4 CABLE.

MAKE SURE THE SYSTEM UNDER TEST
IS NOT PRESSURIZED. CONNECT OTHER
END OF W4 TO J2 OR J3. PERFORM
OFFSET TEST.

3. TURN ON SYSTEM AND READ PRESSURE.

You will have to decide if test 24 gave the wrong result. If test 24 gave a substantially different result than test 49, answer NO to this question.

NOTE
VEHICLE DCA FAULTY. Use the STE/ICE-R in the TK mode for the rest of your testing. See the chart on the foldout page for a way to run the rest of the DCA tests in the TK Mode. Have DS maintenance repair the DCA
when you're finished.

![825_image_0.png](825_image_0.png)

REFERENCE INFORMATION
DCA TROUBLESHOOTING
Make sure the STE/ICE-R is powered by a W5 cable. If the TK mode test tells you that the vehicle has a fault, then return to the paragraph you came from. If the vehicle tests OK, continue here.

You will have to decide if the DCA test result is wrong. If the TK test gave a substantially different result than the DCA test, answer NO to this question.

NOTE
VEHICLE DCA FAULTY. Use the STEΛCE-R in the TK
mode for the rest of your testing. See the chart on the foldout page for a way to run the rest of the DCA tests in the TK Mode. Have DS maintenance repair the DCA
when you're finished.

You can check the connections at the shunt and the power stud to see if they are OK. Look at the schematic for help.

![827_image_0.png](827_image_0.png)

REFERENCE INFORMATION
DCA TROUBLESHOOTING
Remove tachometer, refer to (para 4-13). If you find the tachometer defective, replace it and return to where you came from and rerun the original DCA test. If it fails again return to this question and answer "YES".

Make sure the STE/ICE-R is powered by the W5 cable.

If you don't find any faults in the vehicle, the slot in the oil pump drive could be too worn to drive the tachometer.

If you see this, notify DS maintenance.

You will have to decide if the DCA test result is wrong.

If the TK test gave a substantially different result than the DCA test, answer "NO" to this question.

NOTE
Vehicle DCA faulty. Use the STEACE-R in the TK mode for the rest of your testing. See the chart on the foldout page for a way to run the rest of the DCA tests in the TK mode. Have DS maintenance repair the DCA when you're finished.

a. STE/ICE-R Description and Operation. The following describes the operation of the Simplified Teat Equipment/Internal Combustion Engines (STE/ICE-R) system and contains detailed operating procedures. It is used to test the serviceability of HMMWV vehicles and to perform primary fault detection and isolation.

After the technician has identified a faulty part or subsystem, he is referred to a paragraph number for replacement or repair procedures for individual parts.

b. Description and Operation. STE/ICE-R is a testing system that performs tests and measurement on internal combustion engines. STE/ICE-R measures standard voltage, current, resistance, pressure, temperature, and speed. Special tests, such as compression balance tests end starter system evaluations, are performed by STE/ICE-R. Standard equipment functions including vacuum pressure gauge, compression gauge, lowcurrent tester, and multimeter are features of the STE/ICE-R set. STE/ICE-R is portable and operates on either 12- or 24-volt vehicle batteries or equivalent power source. The STE/ICE-R system consists of a vehicle test meter (VTM), a transducer kit (TK), four electrical cables, a transit case, and technical publications.

c. **Vehicle Test Meter.**
1. General. The VTM provides a method for the technician to test vehicle electrical and mechanical components. Readings are either pass/fail indications or digital displays in units familiar to the technician (psi, rpm, volts, ohms, amps, etc.). The diagnostic connector assembly (DCA) is permanently mounted in the vehicle and provides accessibility to the most frequently needed test points. The use of the VTM through the DCA is referred to as DCA mode. The VTM interfaces with the vehicle directly with a transducer from the transducer kit (TK). The use of the VTM through the TK is referred to as TK mode. The DCA and the TK can be used at the same time This may be necessary when the diagnostic connector assembly has a missing transducer. If a transducer is missing, a no sensor indication (E002) is displayed when a measurement is made. If this happens, the TK mode can be used to make the measurement. The use of the VTM through the DCA and TK is referred to as the combined mode. Additional teats can be done that involve manually probing and/or connecting transduce to appropriate test points. Operating power for the VTM is drawn from the vehicle batteries or some equivalent battery source. Power is routed to the VTM through the DCA connected to the battery. The STE/ICE-R general purpose testing capabilities that maybe applied to the vehicle are: 0-1000 psi pressure, 0-45 volts dc and 0-40k ohms resistance. The following control functions can be performed in conjunction with the special tests: interleave (displays rpm with next test), display maximum value, and display minimum value, and display peak-to-peak value.

2. Controls and Indicators. The controls and readout display on the VTM are illustrated. The following paragraphs describe how the controls are used and how the display functions.

(a) Power Switch (PUSH ON/PULL OFF). The power switch controls DC power to the VTM. The VTM can operate from a 12-volt or 24-volt battery system. When the power switch is pushed in (PUSH ON), the VTM power is on. To shut the VTM off, pull out the power switch (PULL OFF). The power switch contains a 4-amp circuit breaker. The power switch will pop out automatically if something is wrong which causes the VTM to use more power than it should. If the switch pops out, check your hookup carefully and try again before returning the VTM to direct support maintenance.

(b) **TEST SELECT Switches.** The TEST SELECT switches are used to select the actual test to be performed. There are ten positions on each switch numbered 0 through 9. The number dialed into these switches is read by the VTM when you press the test button. Changing the TEST SELECT switch positions has no effect until the TEST button is pushed.

(c) TEST Button. Depressing and releasing the TEST button causes the test measurement to begin.

Observe the measured value on the readout display. The reading will be in unite normally used for the particular vehicle measurement. These units are listed on the flip cards. The TEST button must be pressed and immediately released. Depressing and holding the TEST button down initiates an offset test. Offset tests are described in TM 9-4910-571-12&P.

(d) **Readout Display.** The readout display will show different types of readouts during testing up to a maximum of 4-characters (for example .8.8.8.8). The types of readouts are described in detail in paragraph 3 below and are summarized as follows:
(1) **Statue Readout.** This type of readout keeps the technician informed of what is happening, such as power applied, failed test, etc.

(2) Numerical Readout. This type of readout is the measured value in units of the measurement being made. If you are measuring 0-45 volts dc, the number 24 on the display indicates 24 volts.

(3) Error Readout. This type of readout indicates that the wrong test number was selected, the transducer is not connected, or the VTM is faulty.

(e) Flip Cards. The flip cards list the 2-digit test number system for selecting the various tests. The cards also summarize the test and operating instructions contained herein.

(f) Power/DCA Connector J1. Connector J1 connects the VTM to either a vehicle diagnostic connector using the DCA cable, or to the vehicle batteries using the power cable. Operating power and signals from the installed transducers are supplied to the VTM through the DCA cable.

![850_image_0.png](850_image_0.png)

(g) Transducer Cable Connectors J2, J3. Connector J2 or J3 connects the VTM to any transducer in the transducer kit. Operating power is supplied to the transducer and signals from the transducers are supplied to the VTM through the cable. Connectors I2 and J3 are identical and can be interchanged with each other or used in combination.

(h) Test Probe Cable Connector J4. Connector J4 connects test leads to the VTM when doing

SIMPLIFIED TEST EQUIPMENT INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE (STE/ICE) SYSTEM

3. Readouts. The following paragraphs describe the different types of readouts that can occur during testing.

(a) Status Readout. A status readout keeps the technician informed of what is happening. For

![852_image_0.png](852_image_0.png)

example, .8.8.8.8 is displayed each time the power switch is pushed on. It means that power is applied, and that all elements of the display are operative, it changes to --- 1.5 seconds later, indicating that the VTM is ready to be used for testing. The status readout displays are described in table 2-1.

(b) Prompting Message. A prompting message is a technician action message. It is a signal for you to

![852_image_1.png](852_image_1.png)

do something such as crank the engine. For example, UEH tells you to enter the vehicle type identification number into the VTM. After the technical action is performed, the test will automatically continue.

Prompting messages are listed in table 2-2.

(c) Numerical Readout. A numerical readout is the measured value in units of the measurement

![852_image_2.png](852_image_2.png)

being made. For example, if you are measuring 0-45 volts dc, 12.7 is volts dc. If you are measuring 0-25 psig pressure, 12.7 is psig. The units for each test are listed on the flip card. The numbers displayed in the VTM are always positive unless there is a minus shown to make them negative.

(d) Error Readout. E0001 is a typical error readout. There are 15 different readouts. All error readouts

![853_image_0.png](853_image_0.png)

start with E. An error readout is a warning that you forgot to connect the transducer, selected a wrong test number, failed to start the engine, etc. All of the error messages mean you must correct the problem before continuing testing. Error readouts are listed in table 2-3. If the error message does not go away after corrective action, refer to TM 9-4910-571-12&P.

(e) Confidence Error Readouts. C004 is a typical error readout resulting from the detection of a

![853_image_1.png](853_image_1.png)

faulty VTM during confidence test. For detailed information concerning confidence error readouts refer to TM 9-4910-571-12&P.

Table 2-4. Transducer Kit Components

1. General. The transducer kit contains a pulse tachometer transducer, a pressure and a vacuum transducer and the necessary adapters (bushing, plugs, tees, etc.). Also included in the kit is a current probe for measuring current and a test probe cable for measuring voltage and resistance. Not all fittings have part number markings. The legend will help to identify the items. Before installing any transducer kit item on the vehicle, be sure to clean the mounting surfaces. This is particularly important if you are going to open fuel lines or tap into manifolds. Dirt particles entering the engine can cause damage to both the engine and the transducer kit item. The transducers should kept clean, free of dirt and grease, and handled with reasonable care.

2. Pressure Transducer. The pressure transducers have a small breather hole on the side of the housing which should be kept unplugged. Do not use high pressure.

3. Pulse Tachometer. Make sure that the slotted hole in the engine tachometer drive shaft is clear and not hard packed before installing the pulse tachometer.

4. Threaded Adapters. Observe threaded fittings carefully to avoid engaging straight threads with

![856_image_0.png](856_image_0.png)

pipe threads. Each measurement device (transducer) in the transducer kit has its own identification resistor. The VTM uses this identification resistor to check that the correct transducer is connected for the measurement being made. If the correct transducer is not connected, error code E002 will be displayed.

## 2-44. Vehicle Testing

a. General. To troubleshoot a vehicle problem, the technician can use the STE/ICE-R (vehicle test meter and transducers) and the vehicle test card.

b. Data Entry Tests. For information regarding Data Entry, Cylinder Entry, Vehicle ID Entry, and Data Display Tests, refer to TM 9-4910-571-12&P.

c . **Offset Tests.** The STE/ICE-R VTM performs a test by setting the TEST Select switches to the test number and pressing the TEST button. For some tests, an offset test is required before the test itself can be performed. This is done by selecting the number of the desired test and holding the TEST button down for several seconds. The offset test nulls out characteristic differences in the VTM, test leads, and transducers. It zeros the meter. Once the offset is performed, the VTM automatically corrects for the offset before displaying measured values. The displayed offset value should be checked against limits on the vehicle test card. If the displayed value is outside these limits, either the transducer or the test cable is faulty and must be replaced. This is another form of self-test. The offset is performed when each transducer is connected. All tests requiring offset are identified by a star (*) on the flip cards and by OFFSET LIMITS on the vehicle test cards. The offset test is performed with the test probe cable or transducer connected to the VTM. Care should be taken to see that no stimulus is applied to the transducer. Test probe cable leads should be shorted together. To perform an offset test, dial the test number into the TEST SELECT switches. Press and hold the TEST button until the prompting message CAL appears on the display. A few seconds after release of the TEST button, a number will appear. This is the measured offset value associated with the test probe cable or transducer and cable.

d. **Control Tests.** These tests are used to change (or control) the way a vehicle test is displayed or the way it is run. There are five control tests:
01 Interleave (displays RPM with next test). 02 Display minimum value for next test. 03 Display maximum value for next test. 04 Display peak-to-peak value for next test. 06 Interleave. Control tests 01, 02, 03, 04, and 06 specify the action to be taken by the next test only. A subsequent test will reset the control.

1. Interleave (Test 01). This test alternately measures engine speed and a second parameter such as fuel pressure or alternator voltage. To initiate interleave, dial 01 into the TEST SELECT switches and press and release the TEST button. The prompting message CON will signal the technician to dial into the second test number and again press and release the TEST button.

2. Minimum Value (Test 02). This test displays the minimum value measured during a test. To initiate a minimum value display, dial 02 into the TEST SELECT switches and press and release the TEST button. The prompting message PASS will signal the technician to dial in the desired test number and again press and release the TEST button. The minimum value is displayed and updated whenever a lower minimum value is measured. Entering 02 and the test number again will reset the process and a new minimum value will be displayed.

3. Maximum Value (Test 03). This test displays the maximum value measured during a test. To initiate a maximum value display, dial 03 into the TEST SELECT switches and press and release the TEST
button. The prompting message PASS will signal the technician to dial in the desired test number and again press and release the TEST button. The maximum value is displayed and updated whenever a higher maximum value is measured. Entering 03 and the test number again will reset the process and a new maximum value will be displayed.

4. Peak-to-Peak Value (Test 04). This test displays the peak-to-peak value of 0-45 volts DC (89),
0-1500 amps DC (90), and battery volts (67). To start a peak-to-peak measurement, dial 04 into the TEST SELECT switches and press the TEST button. The prompting message PASS will signal the operator to dial in one of the three numbers (89, 90, 67) and again press the TEST button.

Was brought to you by me:
 Liberated Manuals -- free army and government manuals Why do I do it? I am tired of sleazy CD-ROM sellers, who take publicly available information, slap "watermarks" and other junk on it, and sell it. Those masters of search engine manipulation make sure that their sites that sell free information, come up first in search engines. They did not create it... They did not even scan it... Why should they get your money? Why are not letting you give those free manuals to your friends?

I am setting this document FREE. This document was made by the US Government and is NOT protected by Copyright. Feel free to share, republish, sell and so on.

I am not asking you for donations, fees or handouts. If you can, please provide a link to liberatedmanuals.com, so that free manuals come up first in search engines:
