## Section Ii. Equipment Description And Data 1-10. Equipment Characteristics, Capabilities, And Features

The 1-1/4 ton, 4x4, M998 series of vehicles are tactical vehicles designed for use over all types of roads, as well as cross-country terrain in all weather conditions. The vehicles have four driving wheels powered by a V-8, liquid-cooled, diesel engine. Four-wheel hydraulic service brakes and a mechanical parking brake are common to all models in the M998 series. All vehicles are equipped with a pintle hook for towing. Tiedown and lifting eyes are provided for air, rail, or sea shipment.

## 1-18. Drivetrain Operation

The drivetrain is identical for all models covered in this manual. It converts horsepower into mechanical force to move the vehicle. Major components of the drivetrain are:
ENGINE - The water-cooled 6.2 liter, V-8, Diesel engine provides up to 150 horsepower at 3600 rpm to power the vehicle. The 6.5 liter V-8 engine develops approximately 160 horsepower at 3400 rpm to power the vehicle. The engines are essentially the same on all models except those equipped with deep water fording kit installed, which adds a specially sealed dipstick, dipstick tube, and vented CDR valve.

These differences do not affect engine performance. TRANSMISSION (3L80) - Adapts engine power to meet different driving conditions. The automatic transmission has three forward speeds, a reverse and a neutral. A neutral safety switch prevents the vehicle from being started with the transmission in any selector lever position except neutral. TRANSMISSION (4L80E) - Adapts engine power to meet different driving conditions. The automotic transmission has four forward speeds, a reverse, a neutral and a park. A neutral safety switch prevents the vehicle from being started with the transmission in any selector lever position except park and neutral. TRANSFER CASE - Directs engine-to-transmission power to front and rear differentials simultaneously. This condition means the vehicle is always in four-wheel drive. The transfer case allows for selection of three drive ranges and a neutral position. A complete description of these driving ranges and the recommended driving conditions during which they are used can be found in TM 9-2320-280-10.

PROPELLER SHAFTS - Link transfer case to differentials. Universal joints, located at either end of the front and rear propeller shafts, permit inline driving power between the transfer case and differentials even though they are mounted at different angles.

DIFFERENTIALS - Transmit driving power, via halfshafts and geared hubs, to left and right wheels. The differential ensures power is applied to the wheel having traction, regardless of which wheel is slipping. This feature is called torque biasing. HALFSHAFTS - Transmits power from differentials to geared hubs.

GEARED HUBS - Serve as the front wheel steering spindle and act as the final drive components

![65_image_0.png](images/65_image_0.png) to front and rear wheels.

## 1-19. Fuel System Operation

The HMMWV diesel fuel system operation is identical for all models covered in this manual. It stores, cleans, and supplies fuel for the engine. Major components of the fuel system are:
FUEL PUMP - Draws fuel from fuel tank through the supply line and pumps it to the fuel filter.

FUEL RETURN LINE - Directs unused fuel from the injection pump back to the fuel tank.

FUEL SUPPLY LINE - Directs fuel from fuel tank to the system.

FUEL TANK - Stores 25 gallons of diesel fuel.

FUEL FILLER CAP - Located at right rear side of vehicle, the cap is removed to permit fuel tank servicing.

FUEL INJECTORS - Receive metered fuel from the injection pump and sprays fuel into the combustion chamber.

FUEL FILTER/WATER SEPARATOR- Filters water and sediment from fuel before fuel enters the injection pump.

INJECTION PUMP - Directs metered and pressurized fuel to the eight injector nozzles. It is

![66_image_0.png](images/66_image_0.png)

mounted on top of the engine under the intake manifold.

## 1 - 2 0 . Cooling System Operat I O N

The cooling system removes excess heat from the engine, engine oil, transfer oil, and transmission oil. This system is identical on all models covered in this manual. Major components of the cooling system are:
A**ENGINE TEMPERATURE SENDING UNIT** - Sends signal indicating coolant temperature to gauge on instrument cluster.

B**ENGINE TEMPERATURE SWITCH** - Sends signal to activate control valve system to operate fan when engine temperature exceeds 215°F (102°C) and deactivate when engine temperature drops below 190°F (88°C).

C**WATER CROSSOVER** - Collects coolant from cylinder heads and channels it to the thermostat housing where it is redirected through the cooling system.

D**THERMOSTAT** - Shuts off coolant return flow to radiator until temperature reaches 190°F (88°C).

Coolant is then directed to the radiator through the radiator inlet hose.

E**RADIATOR** - Directs coolant through a series of fins and baffles so outside air can dissipate excess engine heat before the coolant is recirculated through the engine.

F
OIL COOLER - Directs engine oil (lower half of cooler) and transmission oil (upper half of cooler) through a series of fins or baffles so outside air can remove heat from oil.

G
SURGE TANK - Filling and expansion point for cooling system.

H

![67_image_0.png](images/67_image_0.png)

PERSONNEL HEATER - Provides heat for personnel and interior of vehicle.

### 1-20. Cooling System Operation (Cont'D)

FAN - Pulls outside air through radiator to remove heat from coolant. HYDRAULIC CONTROL VALVE - Directs hydraulic fluid to provide required pressure to actuate fan clutch as required by engine temperature. Hydraulic pressure supplied by power steering pump.

TIME DELAY MODULE - Sends delayed signal to fan clutch solenoid for delay of fan actuation to provide needed horsepower for engine acceleration.

FAN CLUTCH SOLENOID - Actuates hydraulic control valve as required by coolant temperature. WATER PUMP - Driven by V-belts provides circulation of coolant through cooling system.

FAN CLUTCH - Hydraulically actuated by pressure from hydraulic control valve to control operation of fan. Hydraulic pressure supplied by power steering pump.

DRAINCOCK - Draining point for radiator and cooling system.

RADIATOR SHROUD - Permits a greater concentration of air to be pulled through the radiator.

![68_image_0.png](images/68_image_0.png)

## 1-21. Starting System Operation

The starting system is identical for all vehicles covered in this manual, and consists of the following components and circuits.

ROTARY SWITCH - When in "START" position, provides battery power to the starter solenoid and to the neutral start switch through circuit 14.

NEUTRAL STARTER SWITCH - When transmission shift lever is in "N" (neutral) position, this switch closes a relay in the protective control box through circuit 14 allowing battery power to reach the starter solenoid. PROTECTIVE CONTROL BOX - Locks out the starter circuit, which prevents starter from reengaging while engine is running.

STARTER SOLENOID - A magnetic relay that transmits 24-volt battery power to the starter motor.

STARTER MOTOR - Cranks the engine for starting, and is supplied 24-volt battery power through

![69_image_0.png](images/69_image_0.png) circuit 6A.
